Context: Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022        that next annual block will be updated to reflect that category’s expanded, and now-filled, capacity   additions.       For waitlisted capacity not met through uncontracted capacity redistribution, Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)   also provides that “the waitlist of projects in a given year will carry over to apply to the subsequent   year when another block is opened.”  Thus, those waitlisted projects will be given priority in selection   within their category under that new delivery year’s capacity allocation to that category.     7.4. Adjustable Block Program Categories   Through the enactment of Public Act 102-0662, three new categories (Public Schools, Community-  Driven Community Solar, and Equity Eligible Contractors) were added to the Program’s existing three   categories (Small Distributed Generation, Large Distributed Generation, and Traditional Community   Solar). Each project application submitted to the program after the passage of Public Act 102-0662   will apply to one of these six categories.   Pursuant to the requirements of P.A. 102-0662, projects in each of these six categories are subject to   the prevailing wage requirements in the Prevailing Wage Act (820 ILCS 130/et seq.), except as noted   within the category descriptions below.308  Prevailing wage is a minimum compensation level by   county set by the Illinois Department of Labor for construction activities related to public works.   Additionally, Public Act 102-0673, which became effective on November 30, 2021, clarifies that   projects receiving incentives under the Program are “public works” subject to the Prevailing Wage   Act —which requires compliance with additional provisions under the Prevailing Wage Act, including   notice requirements.    7.4.1.  Small Distributed Generation   The Small Distributed Generation category includes distributed generation projects up to and   including 25 kW in size. The Small Distributed Generation category will comprise at least 20% of the   ABP capacity generally.   Each project that is constructed in this category will be subject to prevailing wage requirements   included in the Prevailing Wage Act309 except the following types of projects:   •  Projects that serve a single-family or multi-family residential building, and   •  Projects that serve a house of worship and are not greater than 100 kW AC (aggregated with   any co-located projects)   •  Projects  for  which  construction  can  be  demonstrated  to  have  been  completed  before   September 15, 2021, the effective date of Public Act 102-0662.   7.4.2.  Large Distributed Generation   The Large Distributed Generation category includes distributed generation projects greater than 25   kW in size up to and including 5 MW. The Large Distributed Generation category will comprise at   least 20% of the ABP capacity generally.      308 See 20 ILCS 3855 1-75(c)(1)(Q).   309 See 820 ILCS/130 et. seq. Prevailing wage requirements are discussed in more detail in Section 7.6 of this Chapter.   164

This increase in program size will   allow for the solar industry in Illinois to continue to grow and the Agency expects to propose larger   block sizes in the next Long-Term Plan scheduled for finalization in 2024 (including an increase in   the allocation to Equity Eligible Contractor projects as discussed in Section 7.4.6 below).    7.3.4.  Opening of 2022 Delivery Year Blocks & Subsequent Annual Block   Openings   The Agency is faced with a timing challenge for the opening of the 2022-2023 delivery year, given   that each delivery year is now associated with a single block of capacity for each category. This   challenge arises due to the fact that this Long-Term Plan is not expected to be approved by the ICC   until July 19, 2022, while the 2022-2023 delivery year begins June 1, 2022.  The Agency initially   proposed to address this timing challenge through a pause of project applications beginning on June   1, 2022 and extending through August 1, 2022.  During the litigation of this Plan before the      303 These totals are preliminary amounts unadjusted for an unallocated capacity from prior program years.  The final allocation for the   2022-2023 delivery year will be outlined in the next iteration of the ABP Program Guidebook published in accordance with this Final   Plan.   304 At the time of publication of this Plan, the calculation of uncontracted capacity for Program year 2021-22 was not yet complete. Per   Section 7.3.5 of this Plan, block sizes for the 2022-23 Program year will increase slightly based on reallocation of uncontracted capacity.    161

Q: What is the ABP capacity allocation breakdown during the delivery year 2023-2024 for the different program categories?
A: Small Distributed Generation: 20%; Large Distributed Generation: 20%; Traditional Community Solar: 30%; Public School Projects: 15%; Community-Driven Community Solar: 5%; Equity Eligible Contractor Projects: 10%[end]

Context: Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022        7.4.4.  Public Schools   The Public Schools category includes Small and Large Distributed Generation projects as well as   community solar projects that serve a public school in Illinois.324 The Public Schools category will   generally comprise at least 15% of the ABP capacity.  Public Schools projects will also feature 20-year   REC delivery contracts that pay for RECs over time as they are delivered, rather than the front-loaded   payment schedule previously used under the ABP.   Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(iv) of the IPA Act restricts the eligibility of projects under the Public Schools   category to those that are installed “at” a public school.  In accordance with the Commission’s Final   Order approving this Plan, community solar projects developed on land adjacent to a public school   or on school district-owned land are eligible to participate in this category.325   For community solar projects participating in the Public Schools category, the public school at which   the project is sited (or the school district within which the project host is located) must be an anchor   subscriber to the community solar project. As such, the public school or district must subscribe to a   minimum of 10% of the project’s capacity and, by law, cannot exceed 40% of the project’s capacity.    The Agency recognizes that it may be difficult for a school district or public school to predict the levels   of student enrollment – and thereby, energy usage – for the next 20 years.  The Agency will allow   flexibility around the ability of an anchor tenant of a Public School category community solar project   to transfer the subscription to another public school or school district and adjust the subscription   size (within the 10-40% range) as needed.  In order to ensure that the benefits of the Public Schools   category return to the schools that host these community solar projects, the Agency will require that   the hosting public school (or the district within which the hosting school is located) request a waiver   from the requirements as necessary during the subscription term.  The Agency will develop the   waiver process through solicitation of stakeholder feedback and publish the process in the Program   Guidebook.326    For this category, public schools are defined as any school operated by the authority of the Illinois   School Code.327  Public school projects located within Environmental Justice Communities or located   on schools that are categorized as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 school based on the latest annual Evidence-Based   Funding Distribution process by the Illinois State Board of Education shall be given priority in the   allocation process.328   To achieve the desired prioritization, 70% of capacity will be allocated to schools categorized as Tier   1, Tier 2, and schools located within Environmental Justice Communities, and 30% will be allocated   to Tier 3 and Tier 4 schools not located within Environmental Justice Communities. Tiers will be   determined using the prior year results of the annual Evidence-Based Funding Distribution process   conducted by the Illinois State Board of Education.329 Capacity will be further allocated by size within   these two groups of school types. 25% of each allocation will go to projects less than or equal to 250      324 For the December 14, 2021 block opening of capacity for Public Schools, only DG applications were accepted.    325 See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 62.  The Agency understands that the Commission’s finding that ”school   districts only exist if there is a school, and as long as the project is located on school district land, then the project is in effect ’installed at’   a public school“ would allow a distributed generation project to be installed at/on a school district building as well as at/on a public school.   326 See id.   327 See: 105 ILCS 5.   328 Illinois State Board of Education Evidence-Based Funding Distribution process: https://www.isbe.net/Pages/ebfdistribution.aspx    329 Details can be found at Evidence-Based Funding Distribution Calculation (isbe.net) and Environmental Justice Community Search Map   (arcgis.com)   170
