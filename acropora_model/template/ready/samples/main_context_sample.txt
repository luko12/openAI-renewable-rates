Incentive values will be determined through a competitive solicitation   process that awards capacity to projects with the lowest cost bids. This approach will leverage competition to ensure   the lowest possible ratepayer contribution, particularly for large projects benefitting from economies of scale, while   ensuring solar projects continue receiving the incentives they need to build.   Program Launch: The first competitive solicitation is targeted for early-to-mid 2022, following additional stakeholder   engagement throughout this summer and fall.

Context: Rider QFS is available to customers taking service under Service Classifications GS, GST, GP and GT.   QF installations must conform to, and are responsible for all costs associated with, the Company's General   Interconnect  Requirements  for  Customer's  Generation,  according  to  any  applicable  installation   specifications. (See Part II, Section 10)      QF INSTALLATIONS WITH MORE THAN 1000 KW GENERATING CAPACITY     Such installations shall negotiate with the Company for specific contract arrangements to determine the   price, term and conditions to delivered energy and capacity, where applicable; provided however, that in   no event shall payments to the QF installation under this tariff exceed the revenues the Company receives   from PJM (or its successor), net of PJM penalties and charges. Such contracts are subject to BPU   approval.      QF INSTALLATIONS WITH 1000 KW OR LESS GENERATING CAPACITY       Service Charge: $40.00 monthly       Energy Payment: Based on actual real-time PJM load weighted average Residual Metered Load   Aggregate Locational Marginal Price (LMP) for the JCP&L Transmission Zone at the time when the QF   installation delivers energy to the Company.      Capacity Payment: Deliveries from a QF installation that qualify as a PJM Capacity Resource may   receive capacity payments when the installed capacity of the QF installation exceeds 100 kW and meets   the reliability criteria set forth in PJM Manual 18 (See www.pjm.com), as it may change from time to time.   The Capacity Payment, if and as applicable, will be equal to the capacity revenues that the Company   receives from PJM for selling such capacity into the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) capacity auction prior   to delivery, adjusted for all other PJM penalties and charges assessed to the Company by PJM arising   from, among other things, non-performance or unavailability of the QF installation. QF installations   requesting capacity payments must execute an agreement with the Company authorizing the Company   to offer such capacity into the PJM market, including terms and conditions of such sale, and including any.
