Incentive values will be determined through a competitive solicitation   process that awards capacity to projects with the lowest cost bids. This approach will leverage competition to ensure   the lowest possible ratepayer contribution, particularly for large projects benefitting from economies of scale, while   ensuring solar projects continue receiving the incentives they need to build.   Program Launch: The first competitive solicitation is targeted for early-to-mid 2022, following additional stakeholder   engagement throughout this summer and fall.       A Look-back: Solar in New Jersey     New Jersey has supported solar since the initial Renewable Portfolio Standard established in 1999 by the Electric   Discount and Energy Competition Act (EDECA). Over time, New Jersey’s solar industry has grown and matured, now   providing nearly 5,400 jobs.     New Jersey is currently 7th in the nation for installed solar capacity, and 1st for installed solar per square mile.     Why create a new incentive program? While the prior Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) Program has been   successful at driving high numbers of solar installations in the state, it is expensive in part due to its “one-size-fits-  all” structure and the financial uncertainty inherent in its variable, market-driven incentive values.      The SuSI Program will provide incentives tailored to the needs of different projects, thereby enabling the continued   growth of the solar industry at a lower cost to ratepayers.

Rider QFS is available to customers taking service under Service Classifications GS, GST, GP and GT.   QF installations must conform to, and are responsible for all costs associated with, the Company's General   Interconnect  Requirements  for  Customer's  Generation,  according  to  any  applicable  installation   specifications. (See Part II, Section 10)      QF INSTALLATIONS WITH MORE THAN 1000 KW GENERATING CAPACITY     Such installations shall negotiate with the Company for specific contract arrangements to determine the   price, term and conditions to delivered energy and capacity, where applicable; provided however, that in   no event shall payments to the QF installation under this tariff exceed the revenues the Company receives   from PJM (or its successor), net of PJM penalties and charges. Such contracts are subject to BPU   approval.      QF INSTALLATIONS WITH 1000 KW OR LESS GENERATING CAPACITY       Service Charge: $40.00 monthly       Energy Payment: Based on actual real-time PJM load weighted average Residual Metered Load   Aggregate Locational Marginal Price (LMP) for the JCP&L Transmission Zone at the time when the QF   installation delivers energy to the Company.      Capacity Payment: Deliveries from a QF installation that qualify as a PJM Capacity Resource may   receive capacity payments when the installed capacity of the QF installation exceeds 100 kW and meets   the reliability criteria set forth in PJM Manual 18 (See www.pjm.com), as it may change from time to time.   The Capacity Payment, if and as applicable, will be equal to the capacity revenues that the Company   receives from PJM for selling such capacity into the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) capacity auction prior   to delivery, adjusted for all other PJM penalties and charges assessed to the Company by PJM arising   from, among other things, non-performance or unavailability of the QF installation. QF installations   requesting capacity payments must execute an agreement with the Company authorizing the Company   to offer such capacity into the PJM market, including terms and conditions of such sale, and including any   required security. Any losses experienced by the Company resulting from a QF installation’s failure to   perform shall be recovered under its Non-utility Generation Charge.      Energy Payment and Capacity Payment, if any, net of Service Charge, shall be determined monthly on   an after-the-fact basis, and made within 90 days of the QF meter reading date.        METERING COSTS: QF customers shall pay all metering equipment and related costs as required by the   Company and/or by PJM.         INTERCONNECTION COSTS:  QF customers shall pay interconnection costs (see Part II, Section 4.05)   and any line extension costs required to interconnect the QF to the Company’s facilities.         _________________________________________________________________________________   Issued: October 30, 2020            Effective: December 1, 2020      Filed pursuant to Order of Board of Public Utilities   Docket Nos.

MONTHLY RATES, RATE COMPONENTS AND BILLING UNIT PROVISIONS   The monthly rates, rate components and billing unit provisions shall be those as stated under the customer’s   applicable Rate Schedule.  Under this Rider, only the per kilowatt-hour charge components of the customer’s bill are   affected.  The monthly charges shall be based on one of the following conditions:       a)  When the monthly energy meter reading registers that the customer has consumed more energy than the   customer delivered to the Company’s delivery system by the end of the monthly billing period, the customer shall   be charged for the net amount of electricity consumed based on the rates and charges under the customer’s   applicable Rate Schedule for either Delivery Service when the customer has a third party supplier as its electric   supplier, or the combined Delivery, Transmission and Basic Generation Service when the customer has the   Company as its electric supplier; or   b)  If the customer is receiving combined Delivery, Transmission and Basic Generation Service, and the monthly   energy meter reading registers that the customer has delivered more energy to the Company’s delivery system   than the customer has consumed by the end of the monthly billing period, the customer shall be charged the   Customer Charge and any appropriate demand charges based on the customer’s applicable Rate Schedule.  In   addition, the Company shall receive and take ownership of the delivered energy from the customer and the   Company shall credit the customer for that delivered energy.  At the end of twelve consecutive monthly billing   periods beginning with the first month in which net metering becomes applicable (annualized period), the   customer will be compensated for any remaining credits at the average Residual Metered Load Aggregate   locational marginal price for energy, for the annualized period, in the Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland   Interconnection (PJM) Control Area Transmission Zone for the Company.  In the event that a customer leaves   Basic Generation Service prior to the end of the annualized period, the end of the service period will be treated   as if it were the end of the annualized period; or   c)  If the customer has a third party supplier and the monthly energy meter reading registers that the customer has   delivered more energy to the Company’s delivery system than the customer has consumed by the end of the   monthly billing period, the customer shall be charged the Customer Charge and any appropriate demand charges   based on the customer’s applicable Rate Schedule. Monthly meter data will be forwarded to the customer’s third   party supplier in accordance with existing Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Standards.

The customer has one opportunity to select an annualized billing period in accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.   14:8-4.3.      RENEWABLE ENERGY CERTIFICATES   The Renewable Energy Certificates generated by the customer-generator facility are owned entirely by the customer   or the eligible customer’s assignee.        METERING   The watt-hour energy meter at the customer’s location shall measure the net energy consumed by the customer or   the net energy delivered by the customer-generator facility for the monthly billing period.  The Company shall furnish,   install, maintain and own all the metering equipment needed for measurement of the service supplied.
