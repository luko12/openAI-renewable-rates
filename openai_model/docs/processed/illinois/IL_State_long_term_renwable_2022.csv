1. Introduction 
This document constitutes the final version of the 2022 Revised Long-Term Renewable Resources 
Procurement Plan (“2022 Long-Term Plan,” or “Plan”) of the Illinois Power Agency (“IPA” or 
“Agency”)  consistent  with  the  Final  Order  of  the  Illinois  Commerce  Commission  (“ICC”  or 
“Commission”) entered on July 14, 2022.   
This Plan reflects substantial changes made to the Illinois Renewable Portfolio Standard (“Illinois 
RPS” or “RPS”) through the enactment of Public Act 102-0662 (colloquially known as the “Climate 
and Equitable Jobs Act”) on September 15, 2021. The Plan also presents certain updates that the 
Agency had previously proposed in a draft Second Revised Long-Term Plan, which the Agency 
withdrew from public comments after the enactment of Public Act 102-0662.  This Plan will cover 
the renewable energy procurement and programmatic activities conducted by the Agency over the 
next two years. 
1.1. Background 
The Initial Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan (“Initial Plan”) was developed by the 
IPA pursuant to the provisions of Sections 1-56(b) and 1-75(c) of the Illinois Power Agency Act (“Act” 
or “IPA Act”), and Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act (“PUA”).  That Initial Plan1 was 
developed  under  authority  established  through  Public  Act  99-0906  (“P.A.  99-0906”),  enacted 
December 7, 2016 (effective June 1, 2017), which substantially revised the Illinois Renewable 
Portfolio Standard (“Illinois RPS” or “RPS”).  The Initial Plan was approved by the Commission on 
April  3,  2018  in  Docket  No.  17-0838  and  covered  the  Agency’s  renewable  energy  resources 
procurement and programmatic activities for the following two years.  The Agency published the 
final Initial Plan on August 6, 2018.  
Section 16-111.5(b)(5)(ii)(B) of the PUA provides that “[the Agency] shall review, and may revise, 
the plan at least every 2 years thereafter.”  That subparagraph further provides that “[t]o the extent 
practicable, the Agency shall review and propose any revisions to the long-term renewable energy 
resources procurement plan in conjunction with the Agency's other planning and approval processes 
conducted under this Section.” The first Long-Term Plan update process was undertaken by the 
Agency in 2019 starting with stakeholder feedback opportunities, and on August 15, 2019, a draft 
Revised Plan was released for public comment concurrently with the IPA’s release of its draft 2020 
Electricity Procurement Plan.  The Revised Plan was filed for Commission approval on October 21, 
2019 and reflected the Agency’s consideration of comments received.   
Under Section 16-111.5(b)(5)(ii)(C) of the PUA, the Commission then had 120 days to review the 
Revised Plan and enter its Order confirming or modifying the Plan. The Commission approved that 
Plan on February 18, 2020 and the Agency published a final version (“First Revised Plan”) on April 
20, 2020. The Agency subsequently petitioned the Commission to reopen the First Revised Plan to 
provide modifications addressing pressing RPS budget issues on March 3, 2021. The Commission

2,10,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
approved those modifications on May 27, 2021 and the Agency filed a First Revised Plan on 
Reopening in conformance with that Order on June 7, 2021. 
Following that two-year plan updating cycle, the Agency then again conducted stakeholder feedback 
opportunities and released a draft Second Revised Long-Term Plan on August 16, 2021 for public 
comment (concurrent with the release of the draft 2022 Electricity Procurement Plan). However, 
before comments on that Plan were due, in early September of 2021 the General Assembly passed 
comprehensive energy legislation in the form of amendments to Senate Bill 2408. That legislation 
was signed by the Governor, and became effective, on September 15, 2021 as Public Act 102-0662. 
That Act contained a provision that within 120 days, after its effective date, “the Agency shall release 
for comment a revision to the long-term renewable resources procurement plan, updating elements 
of the most recently approved plan as needed to comply with this amendatory Act of the 102nd 
General Assembly, and any long-term renewable resources procurement plan update published by 
the Agency but not yet approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission shall be withdrawn for public 
comment.” As a result, the Agency withdrew the draft Second Revised Plan and began the process of 
preparing a draft 2022 Long-Term Plan.  
For  this  new  2022  Long-Term  Plan,  the  Agency  issued  requests  for  stakeholder  feedback  in 
November 2021 and released a draft 2022 Long-Term Plan on January 13, 2022. After the receipt of 
public comments on that draft Plan, the Agency updated the Plan and filed the 2022 Long-Term Plan 
for approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission on March 21, 2022 in Docket No. 22-0231 and the 
Commission approved that Plan with modification on July 14, 2022.  
This Final Plan reflects changes arising from the Commission’s Order confirming and modifying the 
filed Plan. The Plan as filed has been amended consistent with the IPA’s understanding of the Final 
Order issued by the Commission in Docket No. 22-0231. While the Agency has strived to fully and 
accurately  reflect  the  Commission’s  Order  in  this  update,  in  the  case  of  any  unintended 
inconsistencies between this Final Plan and the Commission’s Order, the Final Order issued by the 
Commission shall govern.   
See Chapter 2 for additional information on the Plan approval process. 
1.2. Evolution of Long-Term Plans 
The Initial Plan addressed the Agency’s proposed set of programs and competitive procurements to 
acquire renewable energy credits (“RECs”) for RPS compliance obligations applicable to three Illinois 
electric utilities: Ameren Illinois Company (“Ameren Illinois”), Commonwealth Edison Company 
(“ComEd”), and MidAmerican Energy Company (“MidAmerican”).  The Initial Plan also described how 
the Agency would develop and implement the Illinois Solar for All (“ILSFA”) Program, which utilizes 
a combination of funds held by the Agency in the Renewable Energy Resources Fund (“RERF”) and 
funds supplied by the utilities from ratepayer collections, to support the development of photovoltaic 
(“PV”) resources, along with job training opportunities (supported separately) to benefit low-income 
households and environmental justice communities across the State of Illinois. The First Revised Plan 
updated those programs and procurements where applicable. 
The First Revised Plan covered the Agency’s proposals for procurements and program activity to be 
conducted during calendar years 2020 and 2021.  As discussed throughout that Plan, absent 
legislative changes, RPS budget limitations would constrain the ability of the Agency to conduct 
additional procurements or expand program capacity for its Adjustable Block Program. That concern

3,11,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
proved accurate, and the Agency was unable to open additional blocks of capacity for the Adjustable 
Block Program beyond those envisioned through the Initial Plan. However, Public Act 102-0662 
required opening new blocks of Adjustable Block Program capacity prior to the approval of a new 
Long-Term  Plan  by  December  14,  2021.  P.A.  102-0662  also  mandated  that  the  Agency  hold 
procurements for RECs from new utility-scale wind, solar, and brownfield site photovoltaic projects 
prior to this Plan’s approval; those procurements occurred in May 2022.  
Public Act 102-0662 contains significant changes to the RPS. Key changes include: 
•  New “40% by 2030” and “50% by 2040” RPS goals, including a new target of 45 million RECs 
from new wind and solar projects delivered annually by 2030.  
•  An increase of the rate used for collections from ratepayers of funding, and changes to 
accounting procedures to provide more flexibility for the timing of expenditures. 
•  Changes to REC procurements conducted to support new utility-scale wind and solar projects 
through incorporating Indexed REC pricing. 
•  A large customer self-direct program that allows very large electric customer to directly 
procure REC from new utility-scale wind and solar projects and reduce their RPS compliance 
costs. 
•  Changes to the Adjustable Block Program to create three new categories of projects for 
projects located at public schools, community-driven community solar, and projects from 
equity eligible contractors.   
•  Changes to the Illinois Solar for All Program including dedicated support for projects that 
promote energy sovereignty.  
•  Expansion, reinforcement, and codification of consumer protection standards applicable to 
transactions under IPA programs.   
•  New  diversity,  equity,  and  inclusion  requirements  on  the  renewable  energy  industry, 
including the implementation of an Equity Accountability System for Agency’s renewable 
energy programs and procurements. 
•  Labor requirements, including prevailing wage requirements, applicable to the Agency’s 
renewable energy programs and procurements.   
This 2022 Long-Term Plan describes how the Agency will implement these and other new provisions. 
The Plan also includes incorporates certain proposals previously contained in the withdrawn Second 
Revised Plan that the Agency believed would improve programs and procurements.  
The Agency has restructured this Plan compared to previous versions. This includes new chapters 
and reorganized sections within chapters. Therefore, section references to previous plans are likely 
not applicable to this 2022 Long-Term Plan.  
With the finalization of the 2022 Long-Term Plan, the Agency will next update the Long-Term Plan 
starting in 2023 for approval in 2024 to cover activities for 2024 and 2025.  
1.3. First Revised Plan Accomplishments 
Subsequent to the approval of the First Revised Plan by the Commission on February 21, 2020, the 
programs and procurements discussed in this Plan met the following milestones: 
•  Block capacity for the Adjustable Block Program filled (by March 2020 for Large Distributed 
Generation; December 2020 for Small Distributed Generation).  
3 
 ",1. Introduction ,[],638,24,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
4,12,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
•  The third program year of the Illinois Solar for All Program opened in June 2020. Project 
applications filled the available funding for the non-profit/public facilities and low-income 
community solar sub-programs, while project applications in the distributed generation sub-
program continued to not meet program goals. The fourth year of the program opened in June 
2021. 
•  A new-wind forward procurement (1 million RECs annually from new utility-scale wind 
projects) was conducted in March 2021. No projects were selected. 
Additionally, many program materials were updated (including Marketing Guidelines, Disclosure 
Forms, the Adjustable Block Program Guidebook, and individual program websites) and the Agency 
has conducted numerous stakeholder feedback and comment processes.   
The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic significantly contributed to delays in project completions in 
2020 and 2021. Nonetheless, as of the finalization of this 2022 Long-Term Plan, 98% of Distributed 
Generation projects and 84% of Community Solar projects from initial Adjustable Block Program 
blocks have been energized and processed for REC payments.  
1.4. Plan Organization 
This 2022 Long-Term Plan contains 10 chapters. 
Chapter 1 is the Introduction, which contains a brief overview of the Plan and a set of action items 
the Agency requested the Commission expressly adopt as part of its approval of this Plan. 
Chapter 2 provides an overview of the statutory requirements governing this Plan contained in the 
Illinois Power Agency Act and the Public Utilities Act, including a historical overview of the Illinois 
RPS’s development and evolution and an outline of the significant changes in Illinois law resulting 
from the enactment of Public Act 102-0662.  
Chapter 3 contains calculations of RPS targets, summaries of RPS portfolios, and summaries of RPS 
budgets.  
Chapter 4 discusses the eligibility of RECs for use in the Illinois RPS. Specifically, it addresses two 
requirements of the RPS: eligibility of RECs from facilities in adjacent states, and the requirement 
that RECs cannot be procured from facilities that recover their costs through regulated rates. 
Chapter 5 describes the competitive procurement process and the procurements the Agency plans to 
conduct for the delivery of RECs from new utility-scale wind and solar projects and brownfield site 
photovoltaic projects.  
Chapter 6 describes the new large customer self-direct program to be implemented by the Agency. 
This program does not feature the procurement of RECs by the Agency on behalf of the utilities, but 
instead authorizes a credit for certain qualifying REC purchases through long-term contracts by large 
electric customers.  
Chapter 7 describes the Adjustable Block Program, which includes details on the following: the 
structure of the blocks; program categories; REC prices; the application process; payment terms; the 
process for approving vendors and designees; project specifications; delivery requirements; and 
more. This chapter consolidates chapters 6 and 7 in the previous plans, which separately considered 
provisions  related  to  distributed  generation  and  community  solar.  Considerations  related  to 
consumer protections are now contained in a new Chapter 9.

5,13,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Chapter 8 describes the Illinois Solar for All Program including the program funding and design, 
customer terms, conditions, and eligibility, and the approach for designating environmental justice 
communities.  
Chapter 9 describes how the Agency implements consumer protection standards. Public Act 102-
0662 created new statutory provisions related to consumer protections in IPA programs, and this 
chapter codifies the Agency’s approach to implementing those requirements. 
Chapter 10 describes the Agency’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion in the renewable 
energy industry through the implementation of the Equity Accountability System, conducting a racial 
disparity study, and development of an Energy Workforce Equity Database. 
1.5. Action Plan 
For this 2022 Long-Term Plan, the IPA recommended that the ICC expressly approve the following 
items as part of the Plan’s approval: 
1.  Approve the RPS targets, and budget estimates for Ameren Illinois, ComEd, and MidAmerican 
for the delivery years 2022-2023 through 2023-2024 contained in Chapter 3, including the 
forecast used for this Plan, and additionally stipulate that Ameren Illinois, ComEd, and 
MidAmerican will provide updated load forecasts and budget data to the Agency on a 
biannual basis (each spring and fall) to allow the Agency to update those numbers.  
2.  Approve the continuation of the Agency’s approach for considering and weighting the public 
interest criteria related to facilities located in adjacent states that is contained in Chapter 4. 
3.  Approve the procurements contained in Chapter 5 including the changes to the procurement 
process to incorporate the Indexed REC approach. 
4.  Approve the design of the large customer self-direct program contained in Chapter 6 
including the process for determining the program size, application process, bill crediting 
methodology. 
5.  Approve the continuation of the basic design of the Adjustable Block Program contained in 
Chapter 7, and approve updates to block design, program categories, schedule of REC prices, 
and program terms and conditions. 
6.  Approve the process for the submission, review, and approval of the proposed contracts to 
procure renewable energy credits or implement the programs authorized by the Commission 
as primarily outlined in Chapters 5, 7, and 8.   
7.  Approve the continuation of the basic design and terms and conditions of the Illinois Solar 
for All Program contained in Chapter 8, as well as the updates proposed in this 2022 Long-
Term Plan. 
8.  Approve the consumer protection standards contained in Chapter 9. 
9.  Approve the Agency’s approach to minimum equity standards contained in Chapter 10. 
The Illinois Power Agency respectfully files this Final 2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources 
Procurement Plan, which reflects the Commission’s Final Order in Docket No 22-0231 approving and 
modifying this Plan consistent with Section 16-111.5 of the PUA.

2. Statutory Requirements of the Plan 
This  Chapter  of  the  IPA’s  Long-Term  Renewable  Resources  Procurement  Plan  (“Long-Term 
Renewables Plan” or “Plan”) describes the statutory requirements applicable to the Long-Term 
Renewables Plan, with a particular focus on changes made through Public Act 102-0662 (colloquially 
known as the “Climate & Equitable Jobs Act”), which took effect on September 15, 2021 beginning 
the 120-day deadline for the initial publication of this Plan.  While not inclusive of all such 
requirements, this Chapter attempts to outline primary requirements while directing readers to 
individual Sections and Chapters in which the Agency’s implementation approach to satisfying those 
requirements is explained in detail.  
A  Statutory  Compliance  Index,  Appendix  A,  provides  a  complete  cross-index  of  statutory 
requirements and the specific sections of this Plan that address each requirement identified.   
2.1. Renewable Energy Resource Procurement Prior to Public Act 99-0906    
The  Agency  has  been  producing  procurement  plans  addressing  renewable  energy  resource 
procurements since 2008 and conducting renewable energy resource procurements since 2009, and 
it is helpful to understand the background of the Illinois Renewable Portfolio Standard’s (“RPS”) 
RPS’s original structure and implementation challenges in understanding the changes made through 
Public Acts 99-0906 and now 102-0662.  
Prior to P.A. 99-0906 (colloquially known as the “Future Energy Jobs Act”), the Illinois RPS effectively 
had three compliance mechanisms depending on a customer’s supply source: eligible retail customer 
procurements, Alternative Retail Electric Supplier (“ARES”) compliance, and hourly pricing customer 
compliance payments.  Below is an outline of the pre-P.A. 99-0906 RPS, provided for background; 
please note that the structure outlined in Section 2.1 below no longer governs RPS implementation 
and compliance in Illinois.   
2.1.1.  Original RPS—Eligible Retail Customer Load  
Of the three former RPS compliance mechanisms, the compliance pathway that looked most like the 
present RPS was that which applied to “eligible retail customers,” or those customers still taking 
default supply service from their electric utility (ComEd and Ameren Illinois, and starting in 2015, 
MidAmerican).    The  Agency’s  annual  procurement  plans  (developed  primarily  to  propose 
procurements  intended  to  meet  the  energy,  capacity,  and  other  standard  wholesale  product 
requirements of eligible retail customers) were required to also include procurement proposals 
intended to meet annually-climbing, percentage-based renewable energy resource targets.  As with 
block energy procured by the Agency, the applicable utility served as the counterparty to resulting 
contracts.   
Sub-targets were also introduced to the overall procurement volumes:  of the renewable energy 
resources procured, 75% were required to come from wind, 6% from photovoltaics, and 1% from 
distributed generation.  Prior to June 1, 2011, resources from Illinois were expressly prioritized 
(looking to adjoining states if none were available in-state, and then elsewhere); after June 1, 2011, 
the RPS required looking to Illinois and adjoining states together as a first priority, and then 
elsewhere.  Funds available for use under RPS contracts were subject to a rate impact cap—a fixed 
bill impact cap percentage (2.015% of 2007 rates), which was then applied to eligible retail customer 
load to produce a renewable resources procurement budget.        
6

7,15,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
This system may have worked more effectively had Illinois not experienced significant volatility in 
the size of its eligible retail customer load.  Upon the establishment of the IPA in 2007, however, the 
General Assembly required that electric utilities execute relatively long-term energy supply contracts 
(known as the “swap contracts”) to serve eligible retail customer load.  In the years that followed, 
energy prices plummeted in the wholesale market, yet these swap agreements served to inflate the 
default supply rate well above that which could be offered by a competitive supplier.  From 2011 to 
2013, significant populations of default supply customers switched to ARES service, often through 
opt-out municipal aggregation,2 and eligible retail customer load dwindled, causing a corresponding 
decline in the annual available renewable resources budget.   
As part of its 2009 Annual Procurement Plan, the Agency proposed, and the Commission approved, a 
procurement for “bundled” (energy and REC) long-term contracts from renewable energy suppliers 
(known as the Long-Term Power Purchase Agreements, or “LTPPAs”). The LTPPA contracts were 
executed through a 2010 procurement event, with winning suppliers receiving 20-year bundled 
contracts to help meet future years’ RPS targets. While this procurement helped facilitate significant 
new renewable energy development in Illinois (especially in the form of wind projects), it also 
provided a floor of annual payment obligations under the renewable resources budget for future 
years.   
As the annual renewable resources budget declined due to customer load moving to ARES supply, 
not only was funding unavailable to conduct additional renewable energy resource procurements, 
but funding was also no longer available to meet the full commitments of the LTPPAs described 
above.  As a result, for two years ComEd’s LTPPAs were “curtailed” (payment was not made through 
the renewable resources budget for the full expected output).  Due to the unpredictability of available 
budgets in future years, the Agency’s annual procurement plans after the 2010 LTPPAs proposed 
only3 the procurement of one-year contracts to meet each upcoming delivery year’s renewable 
energy resource obligations.  As obtaining financing for developing new facilities generally required 
revenue certainty over a long period, this short-term focus left the prior RPS as an ineffective (or 
“broken”) tool for facilitating the development of new renewable energy generation.     
2.1.2.  Original RPS—Hourly Pricing Customers   
Beginning with the 2010 delivery year through June 1, 2017, Section 1-75(c)(5) of the Act required 
that the applicable electric utility apply “the lesser of the maximum alternative compliance payment 
rate or the most recent estimated alternative compliance payment rate for its service territory for 
the corresponding compliance period” to hourly pricing customers.  Those funds were held by the 
electric utility and utilized to supplement to the Agency’s annual procurement planning process. 
Because contracts with distributed generation systems required contracts of at least 5 years, the IPA 
used these hourly Alternative Compliance Payments (“ACPs”) to serve as the funding source for 
procurements supporting DG development, including DG procurements approved in the IPA’s 2017 
Annual Procurement Plan.  
 
2 Under Section 1-92 of the Act, municipalities, whether individually or in a coalition with others, may aggregate residential and small 
commercial electric loads and leverage economies of scale to negotiate favorable electric supply rates for those customers. 
3 The lone exception to this was the procurement of statutorily mandated five-year distributed generation procurements using alternative 
compliance payments.

8,16,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
As discussed in detail in Chapter 3, even accounting for payments still to be made under those DG 
procurements, some balance of prior-collected hourly ACPs remains for REC procurements.      
2.1.3.  Original RPS—ARES Compliance  
Lastly, the ARES RPS compliance mechanism, adopted in 2009, was more complex.  Under Section 
16-115D of the Public Utilities Act, each ARES carried a percentage-based renewable portfolio 
standard requirement similar to the Section 1-75(c) requirement as a percentage of its sales, but 
could satisfy its obligation by making alternative compliance payments at a rate reflecting that rate 
paid by eligible retail customers for no less than 50% of its obligation.  For the remaining 50% of its 
obligation, the ARES could either make additional alternative compliance payments and/or self-
procure RECs from a broad geographic footprint.  
With ARES competing with one another for customers (and against default supply service), this 
paradigm created an incentive for an ARES to comply at the lowest cost possible.4  Thus, alternative 
compliance payments were generally made for the minimum 50% amount, and the self-procurement 
obligation was not structured to lead to the development of new renewable energy generation.   
Alternative compliance payments were deposited into the IPA-administered Renewable Energy 
Resources Fund.  Due to statutory constraints, leveraging this fund for procurements carried 
significant challenges, as the IPA outlined in detail its 2015 Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurement 
Plan.  In addition, as a special state fund, the RERF could always be—and indeed was—subject to the 
risks of borrowing and transfers.  Given these risks, and given the State’s inability to enact a budget 
from July 1, 2015 until August 31, 2017 (thereby leaving the IPA without appropriation authority to 
make payments under contracts regardless of actual funds available), the State of Illinois was an 
unattractive counterparty for REC delivery contracts.    
With the majority of Illinois electric load being served by ARES,5 this stood as no small problem—
while the RPS technically covered most of the electricity delivered in the state, very little new 
renewable generation was able to be developed through it.  Significant amounts were being paid into 
the RERF each year to support renewable energy development, yet the money was unable to be 
effectively leveraged for that purpose.  While ARES were procuring millions of RECs in aggregate each 
year, the incentive structure facing those suppliers made it highly unlikely that those RECs would be 
sourced from anything other than the lowest-priced seller: generally, facilities already built and 
financed, and potentially from projects in vertically integrated states with costs already being fully 
recovered through rates.  Hence, parties seeking changes to this system often characterized the 
Illinois RPS as a “broken RPS,” and one that would require a comprehensive legislative overhaul to 
be properly fixed.    
2.2. Public Act 99-0906 
The Agency’s initial obligation to develop a Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan for 
managing RPS implementation stems from requirements included in Public Act 99-0906.  P.A. 99-
0906 was passed by both the Illinois House and Senate during the last days of the 99th General 
 
4 To the extent that a customer sought a more environmentally friendly product, the ARES could always offer a “green” product including 
100% of megawatt-hours matched with renewable energy credits, disconnected from any RPS compliance obligation.

Assembly on December 1, 2016, and was signed into law on December 7, 2016, with an effective date 
of June 1, 2017.    
P.A. 99-0906’s changes to the RPS were intended to address many of the challenges outlined above, 
especially to ensure that the RPS collections could be effectively leveraged to support new renewable 
energy project development.     
2.2.1.  P.A. 99-0906—Overview    
In addition to the requirement that the Agency develop its Long-Term Renewable Resources 
Procurement Plan and implement the programs and procurement discussed herein, P.A. 99-0906 
also contained other significant reforms to Illinois energy law.  Among those reforms included the 
establishment of a zero emission standard requiring the Agency to develop a Zero Emission Standard 
Procurement Plan for the procurement of zero emission credits from select at-risk zero emission (i.e., 
nuclear) generating facilities;6 revisions to the state’s energy efficiency portfolio standard found in 
Article VIII of the Public Utilities Act (220 ILCS 5), including the elimination of the statutory pathway 
by which incremental energy efficiency programs were included in the IPA’s annual procurement

rebate for behind-the-meter generating facilities.10   
2.2.2.  Changes to the RPS through P.A. 99-0906   
Public Act 99-0906 ushered in several changes to the RPS, including the introduction of new 
concepts, terms, and prescriptive requirements.  Several of these concepts are discussed below, in 
the subsections later in this chapter, and in the Chapters that follow.  Where applicable, the status of 
these changes under P.A. 102-0662’s new RPS framework are also noted.      
2.2.2.1.  P.A. 99-0906—RPS Funding  
P.A. 99-0906 constituted a comprehensive overhaul of the state’s renewable energy portfolio 
standard, elements of which can be found in Sections 1-56 and 1-75(c) of the IPA Act and Section 16-
115D of the PUA.  Under the prior Illinois RPS, compliance and planning depended on how a 
customer’s supply requirements were met, with three separate compliance mechanisms for default 
utility supply service, hourly-pricing customers, and load served by Alternative Retail Electric 
Suppliers.  Changes to the Illinois RPS through P.A. 99-0906 fully transitioned the state’s RPS to a 
streamlined, centralized planning and procurement process, with both RPS targets and available

budgets determined based on an electric utility’s load for all retail customers11 and funding collected 
through a delivery services charge.   
While the rate impact cap found under Section 1-75(c)(1)(E) of the IPA Act technically remained the 
same under Public Act 99-0906 – 2.015% of 2007 rates – budgets available to support renewable 
energy projects increased significantly, as that rate impact cap applied now to all retail sales instead 
of only eligible retail customer load.  In prior years, the annual RPS budget managed by the Agency 
could range from $30 million to $100 million, with the Agency having little visibility in advance as to 
what future years’ budgets would be due to the issues outlined above in Section 2.1.1.  Through Public 
Act 99-0906, by 2019, annual RPS budgets stabilized in the range of $220 million to $230 million per 
year, not considering prior-collected ACPs.  This increased level of funding was essential to meet the 
more aggressive targets found in the revised Illinois RPS, specifically targets related to ensuring that 
RECs were being procured from new wind and photovoltaic projects that may never have been 
developed but for the availability of funding through REC delivery contracts.   
As discussed later in this Chapter and especially across Chapter 3, Public Act 102-0662 further increased 
these budgets and now allows for collections to be leveraged across multiple delivery years, such that 
prior years’ collections can now be utilized meet future years’ expenses.   
2.2.2.2.  P.A. 99-0906—Focus on RECs  
P.A. 99-0906 demonstrated a shift in focus from compliance through the procurement of “renewable 
energy resources”—which may be either 1) a renewable energy credit associated with a megawatt-
hour (“MWh”) of generation, or 2) that REC plus the associated generation—to compliance through 
the purchase and retirement of “renewable energy credits.”12  This change makes intuitive sense; the 
purchase of energy is not addressed through this planning process, and the Agency’s planning for any 
energy purchases can only be for utility default supply customers (i.e., eligible retail customers) 
through the development of a separate procurement plan (which focuses on a shorter timeframe than 
many of the REC contracts envisioned in the revised RPS).   
That  framework continues  under  P.A.  102-0662, with  RPS  goal progress measured through  the 
procurement of RECs rather than renewable energy resources.  The IPA’s 2022 Long-Term Plan thus 
continues to only concern REC procurements, and not the procurement of energy or capacity from 
projects facilitated by this Plan’s proposals.   
2.2.2.3.  P.A. 99-0906—RPS Targets and Goals  
P.A. 99-0906 continued with a “25% by 2025” RPS trajectory that had previously been contained in 
Section 1-75(c) since its enactment in 2008—meaning that 25% of eligible load should be met by 
RECs procured by the Agency by the year 2025—but just as funds to support REC procurements were 
now to be collected from all retail customers, that goal was likewise applied to all retail customer 
load.  A higher priority requirement was minimum procurement quantities of RECs from “new” wind 
 
11 For MidAmerican, the IPA understands that Section 1-75(c)’s renewable energy procurement targets are generally applied to the supply 
procured for MidAmerican’s jurisdictional eligible retail customers and not all retail sales in its service territory.   
12 See, e.g., 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(B), (C).  The law continues to recognize that “renewable energy resources” may be used to satisfy the 
RPS, but focuses this Plan only on the procurement of “renewable energy credits” (which, standing alone, also may constitute “renewable 
energy resources”).

and photovoltaic projects;13 those quantitative REC delivery targets from “new” projects found in 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) operated as follows:   
By the end of the 2020 delivery year (May 31, 2021):   
•  At least 2,000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new wind 
projects; and 
•  At least 2,000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new 
photovoltaic projects.  
By the end of the 2025 delivery year (May 31, 2026):   
•  At least 3,000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new wind 
projects; and 
•  At least 3,000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new 
photovoltaic projects.  
By the end of the 2030 delivery year (May 31, 2031):   
•  At least 4,000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new wind 
projects; and 
•  At least 4,000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new 
photovoltaic projects.  
For the “new photovoltaic project” requirement, at least 50% needed to be procured from solar 
photovoltaic projects using the Adjustable Block Program (used to support distributed generation 
and community solar, as discussed further below), at least 40% from utility-scale solar projects, and 
at least 2% from non-community solar brownfield site photovoltaic projects.   
These concepts still govern RPS compliance under P.A. 102-0662, but with more aggressive goals and 
targets.  As also discussed later in this Chapter and across Chapter 3, Public Act 102-0662 has now 
introduced a “40% by 2030” RPS goal, while targeting the delivery of 45,000,000 RECs from new wind 
and new photovoltaic projects by the end of the 2030 delivery year.   
2.2.2.4.   P.A. 99-0906: Community Renewable Generation  
P.A. 99-0906 introduced the concept of a “community renewable generation project” to Illinois law.  
As defined by the IPA Act,14 this is an electric generating facility that: 
(1) is powered by wind, solar thermal energy, photovoltaic cells or panels, biodiesel, crops 
and untreated and unadulterated organic waste biomass, tree waste, and hydropower that 
does not involve new construction or significant expansion of hydropower dams;  
(2) is interconnected at the distribution system level of an electric utility as defined in this 
Section,  a  municipal  utility  as  defined  in  this  Section  that  owns  or  operates  electric 
 
13 P.A. 99-0906 introduced the standard of a “new” project as being a project not energized before effective date of that Act (June 1, 2017).  
In many cases, that standard still applies to the definition of “new” projects, even after the enactment of P.A. 102-0662.

distribution facilities, a public utility as defined in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act, or 
an electric cooperative, as defined in Section 3-119 of the Public Utilities Act; 
(3) credits the value of electricity generated by the facility to the subscribers of the facility; 
and 
(4) is limited in nameplate capacity15 to less than or equal to 2,000 kilowatts. 
A subscriber’s subscription to such a facility is an “interest” in that facility “expressed in kilowatts” 
which is sized primarily to offset part or all of the subscriber's electricity usage, and may not 
constitute more than 40% of the facility’s nameplate capacity.16  Through subscription, the subscriber 
receives a bill credit for each kilowatt hour produced by that project commensurate with the 
subscriber’s subscription size via net metering, similar to (although not necessarily valued exactly 
commensurate with) if that share of project was sited behind the customer’s meter.   
Photovoltaic community renewable generating projects are frequently described herein (as well as 
in Sections 1-10 and 1-56(b) of the IPA Act) as “community solar” projects, and to ensure that such 
projects are developed, community solar projects have distinct minimum REC procurement targets 
in the Illinois RPS.  Those RECs are procured through proposed community solar projects applying 
to the Adjustable Block Program, described below.   
While Public Act 99-0906 supported only one category of community solar projects in the Adjustable 
Block Program, through Public Act 102-0662, the Adjustable Block Program now supports two separate 
categories of community solar projects (more traditional community solar projects—which tend to be 
large-scale and transactional—and “community-driven” community solar projects).    
2.2.2.5.  P.A. 99-0906: The Adjustable Block Program  
P.A. 99-0906 required the development and ongoing operation of an “adjustable block program” 
(“ABP”).  Used to facilitate the development of new community solar and distributed photovoltaic 
generation projects, the Adjustable Block Program must feature a “transparent schedule of prices 
and quantities” for RECs “to enable the photovoltaic market to scale up and for renewable energy 
credit prices to adjust at a predictable rate over time.”17  This pricing approach represented a 
significant shift in the state’s approach to procuring renewable energy; prior to the enactment of P.A. 
99-0906, past efforts to procure renewable energy resources focused on competitive sealed bidding, 
pay-as-bid procurement events.  Most bidder and supplier information, including resulting contract 
prices and quantities for winning bidders, was considered confidential.  While these competitive 
procurement elements continued to be utilized for other activities under the Illinois RPS, the 
Adjustable Block Program provided open application to a program featuring price transparency 
utilizing administratively-set REC prices established through this Long-Term Plan approval process.   
P.A. 99-0906 provided the following delineation for categories of projects supported under the ABP:   
(1) At least 25% from distributed renewable energy generation devices with a nameplate 
capacity of no more than 10 kilowatts (“Small DG”);  
 
15 “Nameplate capacity” is defined in the law as the aggregate inverter nameplate capacity in kilowatts AC.  20 ILCS 3855/1-10.

(2) At least 25% from distributed renewable energy generation devices with a nameplate 
capacity of more than 10 kilowatts and no more than 2,000 kilowatts (“Large DG”);18            
(3) At least 25% from photovoltaic community renewable generation projects (“Community 
Solar”). 
(4) The remaining 25% shall be allocated as specified by the Agency in the long-term renewable 
resources procurement plan.19 
Projects successfully participating in these categories prior to the enactment of P.A. 102-0662 
received a 15-year REC delivery contract with a counterparty utility, with that revenue received by 
the applicant offsetting the project’s development costs.  Under P.A. 99-0906, those contracts all 
featured some form of prepayment of the revenues due back to the applicant/Seller:  full payment 
upon energization in the case of Small DG projects; and 20% upon energization with the remaining 
80% paid ratably over the next 4 years in the case of Large DG and community solar projects.    
The Illinois RPS post-P.A. 102-0662 maintains the basic structure of the Adjustable Block Program, but 
features several modifications to categories (from three project categories to six project categories), 
permissible project sizes, and REC delivery contract payment structure and terms.  Those changes are 
discussed later in this Chapter.     
2.2.2.6.  P.A. 99-0906: The Illinois Solar for All Program 
Similar to the Adjustable Block Program, the Illinois Solar for All (“ILSFA”) Program was established 
as  a  solar  incentive  program  intending  to  incent  low-income,  non-profit,  and  public  facility 
participation in solar photovoltaic projects—whether as a system owner, community solar project 
subscriber, or system host—through revenue provided by REC delivery contracts.  Reflecting the 
additional incentive necessary to ensure low-income participation, ILSFA REC prices generally 
exhibit a premium above those used for the Adjustable Block Program, with the Agency also having 
the ability to offer full contract prepayment or otherwise relax (or enhance) requirements in 
recognition of the unique challenges facing low-income project development.  As introduced under 
P.A. 99-0906, funding for the Illinois Solar for All Program came from a combination of funds 
collected under Section 16-108(k) collections (i.e., those used to support RPS activities more 
generally) and funds in the IPA-administered Renewable Energy Resources Fund.  As a result of this 
dual funding mechanism, ILSFA REC delivery contracts could feature a counterparty Buyer that was 
either an Illinois electric utility or the State of Illinois itself.   
As established under P.A. 99-0906, the ILSFA Program featured four subprograms generally matched 
to the project or customer type eligible to participate:   
•  Low-Income Distributed Generation Incentive Program 
•  Low-income Community Solar Project Initiative 
•  Non-Profit and Public Facility Incentive Program  
•  Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Project Program    
Unlike the Adjustable Block Program, which operated with block sizes supporting defined quantities 
of new installed solar capacity, the Illinois Solar for All Program featured no hard targets or goals for

the quantity of RECs to be procured.  Instead, it operated (and continues to operate) with annual 
program year budgets for each subprogram.   
Changes to the Illinois Solar for All Program through P.A. 102-0662 include the elimination of one 
subprogram and the introduction of another, a significant increase in the annual utility-collected 
funding used to support the ILSFA Program, and dedicated participation in select subprograms for 
project structures demonstrating “energy sovereignty.”     
2.2.2.7.   P.A. 99-0906: Competitive Procurements  
As referenced above, P.A. 99-0906 maintained elements of the competitive, confidential, “pay-as-bid” 
procurement structure for certain RPS implementation activities—specifically, for awarding REC 
delivery contracts used to support new utility-scale wind, utility-scale photovoltaic, and brownfield 
site  photovoltaic  projects.    Proposed  projects  qualified  through  meeting  project  maturity 
requirements, paying required fees, and posting required collateral, and then offered proposed a 
proposed  quantity  and  REC  price  (or  “bid”)  with  the  lowest-priced  bids  selected  to  meet 
predetermined procurement quantities.   
P.A. 99-0906 defined projects larger than 2 MW in size as “utility-scale” (this threshold is now 5 MW 
under P.A. 102-0662), although economies of scale generally resulted in supported projects being 
much larger than that minimum.  Quantitative new project targets in the Illinois RPS required that at 
least 40% of RECs used to meet new solar photovoltaic targets be derived from utility-scale solar 
projects and 2% from brownfield site projects; for new wind project targets, the entirety was to be 
sourced from utility-scale projects.   
To meet these targets, P.A. 99-0906 required that the IPA conduct “initial forward procurements” 
prior to the approval of its Initial Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan.  Those 
procurements were intended to bring 1,000,000 RECs each of utility-scale wind and utility-scale solar 
under contract, with additional procurements proposed through the IPA’s Long-Term Renewable 
Resources Procurement Plan.  Proposed projects were subject to locational requirements generally 
described in Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) of the Act and outlined in practice through this Plan; under these 
requirements, projects in Illinois were eligible and those in adjacent states may be eligible, but only 
if certain public interest criteria were satisfied.   
Public Act 102-0662 provides a similar structure for supporting utility-scale and brownfield site 
photovoltaic projects, with utility-scale project REC procurement events also required to have been 
conducted prior to this Plan’s approval (within 240 days of the effective date of P.A. 102-0662) and 
additional procurements proposed through this Plan.  P.A. 102-0662 also maintains the general 
competitive procurement framework previously used to select proposed projects, but with a) the ability 
to consider additional factors as part of bid evaluation (such as progress on equity initiatives or project 
locational benefits for communities transitioning from closed power plants) and b) REC delivery 
contracts featuring an indexed REC pricing structure (a REC price that floats upward or downward 
based on assumed energy revenues for the facility).      
2.2.3.  The Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan  
Public Act 99-0906 required the Illinois Power Agency to outline a new procurement plan – the Long-
Term Renewables Procurement Plan – containing proposals for implementing these new programs 
and procurements, and for the management of these increased funds for meeting more aggressive 
14

15,23,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
RPS targets and goals.  This separate, renewable energy-focused planning process was a departure 
from past practice under the Illinois RPS; previously, Illinois law required that renewable energy 
resource procurements used to meet the requirements of Section 1-75(c) of the IPA Act be proposed 
through the Agency’s annual procurement plan developed pursuant to Section 16-111.5 of the PUA.   
The  Long-Term  Renewable  Resources  Procurement  Plan—prepared  pursuant  to  Section  16-
111.5(b)(5) of the PUA—was initially prepared in 2017, was approved by the ICC in 2018, was 
required to be revised at least every two years, and “shall include procurement programs and 
competitive procurement events necessary to meet the goals” set forth in Section 1-75(c) of the IPA 
Act.    That  original  Long-Term  Renewable  Resources  Procurement  Plan  or  “Initial  Plan”  was 
developed over the summer of 2017, published for comment on September 29, 2017, filed with the 
Illinois Commerce Commission for approval on December 4, 2017, and approved by the Commission 
on April 3, 2018 through ICC Docket No. 17-0838.   As that plan is required by law to be updated at 
least every two years, a First Revised Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan was 
approved by the Commission on February 18, 2020 through Docket No. 19-0995.  The Agency 
published its draft Second Revised Long-Term Plan on August 16, 2021 but withdrew the draft in 
accordance with the passage of Public Act 102-0662 as required by that Act’s revisions to Section 1-
75(c)(1)(A) of the IPA Act.  Under those same revisions, this Plan was required to be published within 
120 days of the effective date of P.A. 102-0662 (by January 13, 2022), was filed with the Illinois 
Commerce Commission on March 21, 2022, and was approved by the Commission through Docket 
No. 22-0231 on July 14, 2022.  Updates to the Long-Term Plan will continue on a biannual basis.    
2.3.  RPS Implementation: 2017-2021  
The IPA conducted a variety of program and procurement activities under the structure required by 
P.A. 99-0906; this Section serves to outline certain successes and challenges observed from RPS 
implementation under that RPS structure, as those successes and challenges informed many of the 
statutory changes found in Public Act 102-0662 which serve to shape this Plan.   
2.3.1.  Successes and Challenges 
For successes, Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) introduced quantitative new photovoltaic project and new wind 
project targets into Illinois law; those targets were 2,000,000 RECs delivered annually from each 
category by 2020, 3,000,000 RECs delivered annually from each category by 2025, and 4,000,000 
RECs delivered annually by 2030.  For photovoltaic projects, 50% of the photovoltaic project total 
was required to be sourced from Adjustable Block Program projects, with 40% from utility-scale 
projects and 2% from brownfield site photovoltaic projects.    
Those new project targets were somewhat easily met.  The “first phase” of the Adjustable Block 
Program concluded by late 2020 with all three project categories having been filled, and thus 
accepted project applications met or exceeded the quantities required to meet that 2020 delivery 
year  target  of  1,000,000  RECs  delivered  annually.    Through  procurements  conducted  by  the 
conclusion of calendar year 2019, RECs under contract from utility-scale photovoltaic projects 
exceeded 2025 and 2030 targets, while those from utility-scale wind and brownfield site photovoltaic 
projects exceeded 2020 targets.     
Changes to the Illinois RPS from P.A. 99-0906 resulted in an unprecedented wave of new renewable 
energy development in Illinois—and, specifically, new solar development.  Prior to P.A. 99-0906’s 
enactment, Illinois was estimated to have approximately 70-80 MW of photovoltaic projects installed 
15

statewide.  The Adjustable Block Program alone has now supported nearly 700 MW of new solar 
distributed generation and community solar, with over 20,000 Illinois residents and businesses 
availing themselves of the support provided by this program.  Competitive procurements have 
supported another over 1300 MW of new utility-scale solar projects, and nearly 700 MW of new 
utility-scale wind.  All but one project has been located in Illinois itself, ensuring that economic 
development, energy diversification, and certain environmental benefits generally connect back to 
those Illinois residents and businesses who financially support these initiatives.  The Illinois Solar for 
All Program has observed robust participation in three of the four subprograms provided for by P.A. 
99-0906.    
These successes have not come without significant challenges.  As outlined in Chapter 3, even with 
thousands of megawatts of additional new solar and wind project development, Illinois remains well 
short of the “25% by 2025” trajectory envisioned through P.A. 99-0906’s revised RPS.  Meeting 25% 
of retail sales through REC procurements requires approximately 30 million RECs to be delivered 
annually;  doing  so  through  RECs  from  new  projects  (especially  with  a  large  portion  of  new 
distributed generation and community solar projects) would require a significantly larger RPS 
budget than what was authorized through P.A. 99-0906.  The IPA also held two utility-scale wind 
procurements in 2019 and 2021 that featured no winning bidders, with post-procurement comments 
from potential participants seeking modification to the fixed-price REC procurement structure 
traditionally used in IPA procurements.   
In  late  2020,  the  Agency  also  released  a  revised  RPS  budget  analysis  indicating  that  project 
development  delays  caused  by  COVID-19,  combined  with  the  front-loaded  contract  payment 
structure present in ABP contracts and the inability to roll prior collections forward to meet future 
years’ expenses under Section 16-108(k) of the PUA, would not only freeze additional program and 
procurement activity, but also place projects already in receipt of REC delivery contracts at risk of 
reduced payments.  As structured under P.A. 99-0906, the Illinois RPS would eventually stimulate 
additional renewable energy project development, but only in fits and starts and only after prior REC 
delivery contract obligations were fully satisfied.   
Additional concerns were raised regarding the significant gulf between Adjustable Block Program 
REC prices and those resultant from competitive procurement events used to support new utility-
scale project development, as well as the lack of progress in meeting percentage-based RPS goals.  
Through Resolution No. 153, the Illinois Legislative Audit Commission directed the Auditor General 
to “conduct a performance audit of the Illinois renewable portfolio standard and the Illinois Power 
Agency’s management of the Renewable Energy Credit procurement process and Adjustable Block 
Grant Program.”  The Auditor General’s Office’s report was published on May 11, 2021, and concluded 
with one recommendation, with which the Agency agreed:  
The  Illinois  Power  Agency  should  continue  to  work  to  meet  the  renewable  energy 
percentage-based procurement goals required by 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(B).20   
The Agency had proposed a procurement strategy in its Initial Long-Term Plan to attempt to meet 
the percentage-based procurement goals of Section 1-75(c)(1)(B) of the IPA Act through year-over-
year “spot procurements” intended to procure RECs from built and existing projects that qualified 
for the Illinois RPS.  That procurement approach was rejected by the Commission in Docket No. 17-

0838, with instruction that any available budget instead be focused on procurements intended to 
facilitate the development of new projects.  So long as the development of new projects was 
prioritized over technical percentage-based RPS compliance – and thus REC prices reflected the 
incentive needed to facilitate new project development, and not the price of RECs sold in liquid 
markets from already-built and financed renewable energy projects – existing RPS budgets would 
always remain insufficient for meeting a “25% by 2025” requirement.   
In addition to these quantitative REC procurement and RPS budget concerns, critiques were also put 
forward regarding qualitative aspects of how the clean energy economy developed in Illinois.  While 
the opening of the Adjustable Block Program facilitated many times more community solar project 
applications than could be supported through the Program – which itself resulted in challenges 
through utilization of a random selection process for project selection, and the disconnect between 
that project selection process and priority in utility interconnection queues – community solar 
projects were generally large and transactional, built to maximum size in agrarian areas to leverage 
low land costs and economies of scale.  This was not the more localized, community-driven model 
that some advocates had envisioned.  Labor interests voiced concern about whether fair wages were 
paid to those employed to meet the growing number of solar installations located in the state.   
Perhaps  most  importantly,  advocates  and  others  shared  repeated  concerns  over  whether 
implementation of the RPS under P.A. 99-0906 created an equitable distribution of the benefits of the 
growing clean energy economy, especially regarding those employed in project development work.  
While P.A. 99-0906 contained open-ended qualitative statements and legislative findings about 
ensuring the equitable distribution of benefits from Illinois’s clean energy economy, actual program 
and project qualification requirements (outside of the low income-focused Illinois Solar for All 
Program) focused more on ensuring that the Illinois RPS resulted in new project development—and 
not on where within the state those projects were developed, who was employed to work on those 
projects, and who ultimately received benefits from those projects.  Without firm requirements in 
place, loose qualitative and directional statements proved insufficient for driving desired outcomes.   
The approach taken through P.A. 99-0906 to RPS implementation was nonetheless a meaningful shift 
in the state’s renewable energy requirements: prior to 2017, the state’s approach could have been 
understood as governed by the logic that statutory RPS compliance should be achieved at “the lowest 
total cost over time, taking into account any benefits of price stability,”21 as these criteria governed 
the  Agency’s  annual  procurement  plan.      The  Illinois  RPS  as  modified by  P.A.  99-0906  thus 
represented a significant step forward because it drove large volumes of new renewable energy 
project development.  But, to many, another step was needed to ensure that state-administered funds 
used to support new renewable energy project development were leveraged in a more targeted, 
socially-beneficial manner.     
2.3.2.  Legislative Proposals  
Dating  back  to  2019,  multiple  bills  were  introduced  that  sought  to  address  these  and  other 
challenges.   Significant energy bills introduced included the following:22

While the Illinois General Assembly convened only intermittently in 2020 after the COVID-19 
pandemic emerged, Senate-organized working groups met across the spring of 2020 and were 
followed by working groups organized by the Governor’s Office across the summer and fall of 2020.  
Additional House and Senate legislative working groups were convened across April and May of 
2021, with interested stakeholders working diligently toward compromise legislation borrowing 
elements from each of the above-listed bills.  Drafts of omnibus energy bills incorporating elements 
of these and other proposals were produced by legislative staff across the final week of the General 
Assembly’s Spring 2021 session. That session concluded on May 31, 2021 without meaningful 
legislative advancement, despite significant progress in negotiations.   
Additional negotiations occurred across the summer of 2021, culminating in the introduction and 
passage of amended Senate Bill 2408 by the Illinois House on September 9, 2021 and the Illinois 
Senate on September 13, 2021.  This bill, known colloquially as the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, 
was signed into law by Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker on September 15, 2021 (establishing its effective 
date, which then informs many deadlines stemming from the legislation) as Public Act 102-0662.    
2.4. Public Act 102-0662: The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act 
Public Act 102-0662 constitutes a significant reshaping of energy law in Illinois—and not only with 
respect to the Illinois RPS.  In addition to the revisions discussed within this Plan, P.A. 102-0662 also 
creates a policy target for the State of Illinois of 100% clean energy by 2050; offers a decarbonization 
schedule for the closure of fossil-based electric generating facilities; introduces additional support 
for at-risk nuclear plants through the procurement of carbon mitigation credits; provides financial 
support for communities faced with generating facility closures; establishes significant financial 
support for the clean energy workforce; establishes beneficial electrification, electric vehicle, and 
energy storage initiatives; contains numerous ethics and ratemaking reforms applicable to Illinois 
electric utilities; and addresses a litany of other issues too numerous to recount here.   
With respect to the Illinois RPS and those activities governed by and proposed through this Plan, 
changes found in Public Act 102-0662 generally take three forms.  The first is volume: through 
changes to Section 1-75(c)(1)(E), annual collections under the Illinois RPS are projected to total over 
$580 million, versus the ~$230 million previously collected.  Through changes to Section 16-108(k) 
of the Public Utilities Act, prior years’ collections can now be rolled over to meet future years’ 
expenses, allowing for more budget to be leveraged than under P.A. 99-0906’s structure.  Utility 
collections used to support the Illinois Solar for All Program grow from ~$11 million annually to up 
to $50 million annually.   
Those volumetric changes can also be found in the REC procurement goals and targets in Section 1-
75(c)(1)(B) and (C) of the Act.  Section 1-75(c)(1)(B)’s prior “25% by 2025” RPS standard has been 
replaced  by  more  aggressive  “40%  by  2030”  and  “50%  by  2040”  requirements.    Section  1-
75(c)(1)(C)’s prior targets of 8,000,000 RECs delivered annually from new projects by 2030 is now 
an  ambitious  45,000,000  REC  procurement  target.    The  scale  of  the  Illinois  RPS  has  grown 
considerably through P.A. 102-0662.

19,27,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
A second category of changes are qualitative changes, through which existing activities already 
conducted under P.A. 99-0906’s structure will continue, but with qualitative considerations offering 
a different form to or process for that work.  One key example of this is the Adjustable Block Program: 
that program previously featured three categories of projects (Small DG, Large DG, and Community 
solar), but changes to Section 1-75(c)(1)(K) now transition the ABP to six categories (with the 
addition of Public Schools, Community-Driven Community Solar, and Equitable Eligible Contractor 
categories), demonstrating more attention paid to the qualitative attributes of projects supported by 
or applicants to the program.  Given its role in establishing requirements for funding eligibility, the 
IPA  had  previously  exercised  consumer  protection  oversight  for  solar  transactions  in  Illinois 
benefitting  from  state-administered  incentive  funding;  that  consumer  protection  role  is  now 
memorialized and expanded through changes to Section 1-75(c)(1)(M) of the Act.  
New labor requirements also fit this description.  Under Section 1-75(c)(7), P.A. 99-0906 required all 
new photovoltaic projects and distributed generation projects to be installed by “qualified persons.”  
As modified by P.A. 102-0662, that “qualified person” requirement remains, but is now accompanied 
by Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q)’s prevailing wage requirements for most new Adjustable Block Program 
projects and both prevailing wage and project-labor agreement requirements for new utility-scale 
and brownfield site photovoltaic projects.    
The largest qualitative changes concern new diversity, equity, and inclusion requirements.  P.A. 99-
0906 provided aspirational statements, such as that RPS programs and procurements “shall provide 
employment opportunities for all segments of the population and workforce, including minority-
owned  and  female-owned  business  enterprises.”23    P.A.  102-0662  distills  those  aspirational 
statements  down  to specific  requirements of  participants:  new Section 1-75(c-10)  of  the  Act 
establishes minimum equity standards under which “at least 10% of the project workforce for each 
entity participating . . . must be done by [sic] equity eligible persons or equity eligible contractors.”  
That percentage rises to 30% by 2030 under a schedule established by the Agency.  For competitive 
procurements,  Section  1-75(c-10)(3)  requires  that  “the  Agency  shall  develop  bid  application 
requirements and a bid evaluation methodology for ensuring that utilization of equity eligible 
contractors . . . is optimized,” constituting a potentially significant shift from evaluating qualified bids 
based only on price.  Other new diversity, equity, and inclusion provisions require compliance 
reporting by Approved Vendors, Agency diversity reporting, and the development of a disparity 
study.     
A third category of changes is scope; P.A. 102-0662 authorizes new activities that the Agency had not 
previously conducted.  Of these, two are particularly noteworthy.  First, the IPA is directed to conduct 
a pair of procurements pursuant to new Section 1-75(c-5) of the Act intended to support the 
development of new utility-scale photovoltaic projects coupled with storage “at or adjacent to the 
sites of electric generating facilities that burn or burned coal as their primary fuel source.”  These 
“coal to solar” procurements operate with statutorily established REC prices, maximum procurement 
quantities, project location requirements, and REC delivery timelines—thus functioning more akin 
to an application process than open-ended competitive procurements traditionally undertaken by 
the Agency.  While these “coal-to-solar” procurements are not proposed through this Plan (with the 
first undertaken during this Plan’s consideration), and the mechanism for funding payments under 
this contract is distinct from that which funds general RPS activities, RECs procured by counterparty 
 
23 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(7).

20,28,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
utilities under these coal-to-solar procurements “may be included or counted for purposes of 
compliance with the amounts of renewable energy credits required to be procured pursuant to 
subsection (c) of this Section to the extent that there are otherwise shortfalls in compliance with such 
requirements.”24    
Second, new Section 1-75(c)(1)(R) of the Act requires that the Agency “establish a self-direct 
renewable portfolio standard compliance program for eligible self-direct customers that purchase 
renewable energy credits from utility-scale wind and solar projects through long-term agreements 
for purchase of renewable energy credits.”  Under this self-direct program, by virtue of entering into 
qualifying long-term agreements for the purchase of RECs from new utility-scale wind or solar 
projects, select customers become eligible for a credit back for certain bill charges levied to support 
the Illinois RPS pursuant to Section 16-108(k) of the PUA.  While this self-direct program bears some 
similarity with Section 16-115D of the PUA’s previous RPS compliance regime for alternative retail 
electric suppliers, ARES compliance within that regime was overseen by the ICC rather than the IPA 
and ultimately sunset through P.A. 99-0906’s changes to Section 16-115D.    
This is just an exemplary overview of changes brought on by Public Act 102-0662, and new 
requirements are discussed in more detail through the Chapters ahead.  As with prior Long-Term 
Plans, the following sections of this Chapter 2 provide an overview of specific legal requirements 
applicable to this Plan, with updates in content and new sections offered to reflect changes present 
in P.A. 102-0662.   
2.5. Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan  
As outlined above, Illinois law requires that the IPA develop a Long-Term Renewable Resources 
Procurement Plan to guide implementation of its renewable energy programs and procurements.  
The Initial Plan was approved by the Commission on April 3, 2018 through Docket No. 17-0838 and 
a  First  Revised  Long-Term  Renewable  Resources  Procurement  Plan  was  approved  by  the 
Commission on February 18, 2020 through Docket No. 19-0995.  This 2022 Long-Term Plan has been 
prepared, published, and filed pursuant to Section 1-75(c)(1)(A) of the IPA Act, as modified by Public 
Act 102-0662, and Section 16-111.5(b)(5) of the PUA, and was approved by the Illinois Commerce 
Commission through Docket No. 22-0231 on July 14, 2022. 
2.5.1.  Plan Requirements  
While Illinois law lacks any single list of required elements for the Plan, both Section 16-111.5(b) of 
the PUA and Sections 1-56 and 1-75 of the IPA Act contain discrete requirements for various elements 
of this Plan.  
2.5.1.1.  Section 16-111.5(b) Requirements  
Section 16-111.5(b)(5) of the PUA provides that “[t]he Agency shall prepare a long-term renewable 
resources procurement plan for the procurement of renewable energy credits under Sections 1-56 
and 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act for delivery beginning in the 2017 delivery year,”25 with 
“delivery year” defined as “the consecutive 12-month period beginning June 1 of a given year and

21,29,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
ending May 31 of the following year.”26  The PUA also contains certain discrete requirements for what 
the Plan must contain or what the Commission must approve. 
First, the Plan must “[i]dentify the procurement programs and competitive procurement events 
consistent with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Power Agency Act and shall be designed 
to achieve the goals set forth in subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of that Act.”27  While the term 
“competitive procurement event” is not defined in either the IPA Act or the PUA, the IPA understands 
the term “competitive procurement event” to be an element of, if not commensurate with, a 
“competitive procurement process” or “competitive bid process,” which the PUA describes as subject 
to  the  requirements  of Section  16-111.5(e)-(i) where  applicable  (i.e., conducted  in  a manner 
consistent with the Agency’s prior competitive procurements).28  The term “program” presumably 
refers to the programs specifically referenced in Section 1-56(b) and Sections 1-75(c)(1)(K) and (N) 
of the IPA Act.  This Plan’s specific procurement programs and procurement events designed to meet 
the goals of Section 1-75(c) can be found in Chapters 4 through 10.   
Second, the Plan must “[i]nclude a schedule for procurements for renewable energy credits from 
utility-scale wind projects, utility-scale solar projects, and brownfield site photovoltaic projects 
consistent with subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois 
Power Agency Act.”29  This subparagraph concerns the quantitative procurement targets for RECs 
from new solar and wind facilities found in Section 1-75(c), and the schedule for those procurements 
can be found in Chapter 5.    
Third, the Plan must “[i]dentify the process whereby the Agency will submit to the Commission for 
review and approval the proposed contracts to implement the programs required by such plan.”30  
Both REC delivery contracts and the IPA’s program administrator contracts31 must be approved by 
the Commission prior to execution.32  The IPA’s process for submitting contracts to the Commission 
for review and approval can be found in Chapters 7 and 8 of the Plan; it does not meaningfully differ 
from that which was proposed in the Initial Plan and First Revised Plan.  As this requirement concerns 
only  “the  programs  required  by  such  plan,”  this  requirement  does  not  impact  the  contract 
development  process  for  the  competitive  procurements  described  in  Chapter  5,  although 
Commission  approval  is  also  required  prior  to  the  execution  of  contracts  for  competitive 
procurements under the process described in Section 16-111.5(e)-(i). 
Through changes enacted through P.A. 102-0662, Section 16-111.5(b)(5)(ii)(D) also now requires 
that the Commission “approve or modify the Agency's proposal for minimum equity standards” 
developed pursuant to Section 1-75(c-10) of the IPA Act, and “consider any analysis performed by 
 
26 20 ILCS 3855/1-10.   
27 220 ILCS 5/16-111.5(b)(5)(ii)(B)(aa). 
28 220 ILCS 5/16-111.5(b)(5)(iii).   
29 220 ILCS 5/16-111.5(b)(5)(ii)(B)(bb). 
30 220 ILCS 5/16-111.5(b)(5)(ii)(B)(cc). 
31 For the Agency’s third-party program administrators, Section 16-111.5(b)(5)(iii) provides that “[t]hird parties shall not begin 
implementing any programs or receive any payment under this Section until the Commission has approved the contract or contracts under 
the process authorized by the Commission in item (D) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (5) of this subsection (b) and the third party and 
the Agency or utility, as applicable, have executed the contract.”   
32 In its Order approving the Initial Plan, the Commission held that under Section 16-111.5(b)(5)(iii)’s requirements, “it must review the 
individual [REC delivery] contracts between the utilities and Approved Vendors and “not just a master contract, although “a master 
contract that is updated by a confirmation agreement providing the batch details regarding seller, buyer, price, term, project location, etc. 
is a reasonable approach.”  Docket No. 17-0838, Final Order dated April 3, 2018 at 116.

the Agency in developing its proposal, including past performance, availability of equity eligible 
contractors, and availability of equity eligible persons at the time the long-term renewable resources 
procurement plan is approved.”  The Agency’s proposed approach to minimum equity standards and 
Section 1-75(c-10) implementation can be found in Chapter 10.   
2.5.1.2.  Section 1-75 Requirements   
Section 1-75 of the IPA Act contains the most robust set of requirements for the long-term plan; those 
include the following:   
First, the Plan must “attempt to meet the goals for procurement of renewable energy credits to meet 
at least the following overall percentages: 13% by the 2017 delivery year; increasing by at least 1.5% 
each delivery year thereafter to at least 25% by the 2025 delivery year; increasing by at least 3% 
each delivery year thereafter to at least 40% by the 2030 delivery year, and continuing at no less than 
40% for each delivery year thereafter” with an additional goal of 50% by delivery year 2040.”33  These 
percentages are described as a portion of each utility’s “load for all retail customers,” which includes 
load served by alternative retail electric suppliers.  The law also provides that “in the event of a 
conflict between these goals and the new wind and new photovoltaic procurement requirements 
…the  long-term  plan  shall  prioritize  compliance  with  the  new  wind  and  new  photovoltaic 
procurement requirements described in items (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph 
(1) over the annual percentage targets described in this subparagraph (B).”34   
In Docket No. 17-0838, the Commission’s Order approving the Initial Plan determined that any 
procurements  originally  proposed  to  meet  annual  percentage-based  renewable  energy  credit 
procurement goals should be cancelled to avoid any potential conflicts with meeting “statutory long-
term  new  build  requirements.”35    Public  Act  102-0662  appears  to  have  memorialized  that 
Commission directive, with Section 1-75(c)(1)(B) now instructing that “[t]he Agency shall not 
comply  with  the  annual  percentage  targets  described  in  this  subparagraph  (B)  by  procuring 
renewable energy credits that are unlikely to lead to the development of new renewable resources.” 
This new language would appear to bar the Agency from proposing RPS procurement approaches 
like the IPA’s prior-proposed “spot procurements,” which sought to fill RPS compliance gaps through 
one-year contracts for the delivery of RECs from existing projects.  Further discussion about progress 
toward these RPS goals is covered in Chapter 3, and application of this new statutory provision in 
prohibiting program participation from photovoltaic systems energized after June 1, 2017 whose 
development had previously been supported through IPA-administered REC delivery contracts can 
be found in Chapter 7.      
Second, the Plan “shall include the procurement of renewable energy credits in amounts equal to at 
least” the new wind and new photovoltaics targets found in Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) of the IPA Act.  
These targets are 10,000,000 RECs delivered annually by the end of the 2021 delivery year, 
increasing ratably to reach 45,000,000 RECs delivered annually by the end of the 2030 delivery year.  
Of that amount, the Agency shall attempt to procure “45% from wind projects and 55% from 
photovoltaic projects.”

23,31,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Within the category of “new photovoltaic projects,” 50% of photovoltaic RECs are to be procured 
through the Adjustable Block Program (and thus from distributed generation or community solar 
projects), 47% from utility-scale (above 5 MW) photovoltaic projects, 3% from brownfield site 
photovoltaic projects that are not community renewable generation projects.  To ensure success in 
meeting this brownfield site photovoltaic procurement requirement, Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)(i) also 
now  directs  the  Long-Term  Plan  to  “consider  other  approaches,  in  addition  to  competitive 
procurements,  that  can  be  used  to  procure  renewable  energy  credits  from  brownfield  site 
photovoltaic projects.”  Further discussion of these quantitative new build targets, including a 
discussion of progress made toward meeting these targets to date, can be found in Chapter 3, while 
the IPA’s approach to brownfield site photovoltaic procurements can be found in Chapter 5.     
Third, the law requires that, to the extent that annual RPS spending budgets36 for each utility become 
a binding constraint, the Plan “shall prioritize compliance with the requirements of this subsection 
(c) regarding renewable energy credits” in the manner discussed in Section 1-75(c)(1)(F), which 
features the following priority ranking:   
(i) renewable energy credits under existing contractual obligations as of June 1, 2021; 
(ii) funding for the Illinois Solar for All Program as described in Section 1-75(c)(1)(O);  
(iii) renewable energy credits necessary to comply with the new wind and new photovoltaic 
procurement requirements in Section 1-75(c)(1)(C); and 
(iv) renewable energy credits necessary to meet the remaining requirements of Section 1-
75(c) (including the percentage-based delivery year goals in Section 1-75(c)(1)(B)).37 
This statutory language and related considerations were placed at issue in the Reopening of Docket 
No. 19-0995, the proceeding for Commission approval of the Revised Long-Term Plan.  Through the 
IPA’s March 3, 2021 Petition to Reopen, the Agency sought for the Commission to approve a regime 
under which REC delivery contract payments would possibly be subject to deferral should expenses 
exceed collections for an upcoming delivery year, as the IPA then expected this would be the case for 
two of the three utilities in the 2021-22 delivery year.  Relying in part on Section 1-75(c)(1)(F), the 
IPA argued that REC delivery contracts pre-dating Public Act 99-0906’s passage and Illinois Solar for 
All contracts should be exempted from any payment deferrals, as those contracts feature statutory 
priority.  In its May 27, 2021 Order on Reopening, the Commission agreed.38    
The IPA is very optimistic that through changes found in Section 16-108(k) of the PUA and Section 1-
75(c)(1)(E)  of  the  IPA  Act  this  prioritization  becomes  a  less  acute  concern  in  future  years.  
Specifically, the changes to these sections of the PUA and IPA Act under P.A. 102-0662 allow for prior 
years’ collections to meet future years expenses on a first-in, first-out basis across a five-year period 
and more than double the size of the budget available to support RPS activities.  However, as separate 
language in Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act directs the IPA to “continue to procure renewable 
energy credits until that budget is exhausted” even if goals and targets are met, the statutory directive 
from Public Act 102-0662 appears to be to maximize RPS expenses to the greatest extent possible.  
 
36 The statutory cost cap and resulting budgets for RPS spending, directed in Section 1-75(c)(1)(E) of the Act, are discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 3 of this 2022 Long-Term Plan.

The Agency’s approach to establishing what budgets are available for upcoming delivery years and 
how those budget projections inform procurement quantities can be found in Chapter 3.   
Fourth,  the  law  requires  that  renewable  energy  credits  procured  under  the  Initial  Forward 
Procurements39 shall be included in the Agency's long-term plan and shall apply to Section 1-75(c)’s 
goals.40  While not so expressly stated in the law, the Agency assumes that RECs procured under 
activities envisioned under Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iii) (Subsequent Forward Procurements within 
240 days of the effective date of P.A. 102-0662) and (iv) (ABP reopening within 90 days of the 
effective date of P.A. 102-0662) are likewise required to be included in this Plan’s accounting of 
progress toward RPS goals and targets.  The results of the Initial Forward Procurements, conducted 
in  three  events  from  August  2017  through  April  2018,  are  reflected  in  the  Agency’s  target 
procurement quantities found in Chapter 3 of this 2022 Long-Term Plan; the Agency has updated 
Chapter 3’s tables related to RECs under contract for Adjustable Block Program reopening and 
subsequent forward procurements as that data is now available.   
Fifth, in transitioning to the new Indexed REC price structure for competitive procurements – under 
which REC prices rise as assumed energy revenues fall through a reduction in wholesale energy 
prices, and vice versa – Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(v)(4) allows for the Agency to “consider the institution 
of  a  price  collar  on  REC  prices  paid  under  indexed  renewable  energy  credit  procurements 
establishing floor and ceiling REC prices applicable to indexed REC contract prices.”  Any proposed 
Indexed REC price collars are required to be filed by the Agency within its Long-Term Plan; this issue 
is discussed further in Chapter 5.    
Sixth, the Plan must describe in detail how each “public interest factor” enumerated in Section 1-
75(c)(1)(I) “shall be considered and weighted for facilities located in states adjacent to Illinois” in 
determining whether those facilities’ RECs may be considered “eligible” to satisfy the Illinois RPS.  
The Agency’s approach for applying these criteria can be found in Chapter 4; while generally similar 
to the content published in prior plans, Chapter 4 also addresses new statutory language related to 
qualifying RECs associated with electricity transmitted to high-voltage direct current converter 
stations introduced through Public Act 102-0662.   
Seventh, pursuant to Section 1-75(c)(1)(J), the Plan shall provide that renewable energy credits 
previously purchased from generating systems previously understood not to be rate-based for a 
state-regulated  entity,  but  which  end  up  being  so  rate-based,  shall  be  made  up  through  a 
procurement conducted in the Agency’s next procurement event and funded through amounts 
returned under the terms of the REC delivery contract.  This connects back to a statutory requirement 
that “renewable energy credits shall not be eligible to be counted toward” RPS targets “if they are 
sourced from a generating unit whose costs were being recovered through rates regulated by this 
State or any other state or states on or after January 1, 2017.”41  It appears that this could be 
accomplished through an adjustment in procurement volumes for subsequent procurement events, 
and the IPA commits to make any such adjustments.  To date, the IPA is unaware of any instances for 
 
39 The Initial Forward Procurements are those conducted under Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(i) and (ii) of the IPA Act.

which this provision (which is reflected in all program and procurement contracts) has needed to be 
enforced.42    
Eighth, the Plan “shall include an Adjustable Block program for the procurement of renewable energy 
credits from new photovoltaic projects that are distributed renewable energy generation devices or 
new photovoltaic community renewable generation projects.”43  A detailed description of the 
Agency’s Adjustable Block Program can be found in Chapter 7.  That Program now features six project 
categories rather than three, with a transition to an annual block structure also required by P.A. 102-
0662’s changes.  Statutory text establishing each of the new project categories also provides discrete 
requirements for Plan content:  
•  For the Public Schools category, the “proposed quantities or blocks, pricing, and contract 
terms” are to be included along with “the renewable energy credit price” and “payment 
terms,” with those terms designed to “make it feasible and affordable for public schools to 
install photovoltaic distributed renewable energy devices.” 
•  For the community-driven community solar project category, “the Agency shall develop 
selection criteria for projects participating in this category” and define “terms and guidance” 
for this selection criteria through the Plan. 
•  For the Equity Eligible Contractor category, the capital advancement structure (through 
which  applicant  projects  may  receive  payment  for  anticipated  REC  delivery  revenues 
predating project energization), including “[t]he amount or percentage of advanced capital” 
and how that advancement structure is informed by an applicant’s demonstration of need, is 
to be established through the Plan.        
Ninth, pursuant to Section 1-75(c)(1)(M) of the Act, the Long-Term Plan shall also include “the 
Adjustable Block program terms, conditions, and requirements, including the prices to be paid for 
renewable energy credits, where applicable, and requirements applicable to participating entities 
and project applications.”  These “terms, conditions, and requirements” must also now include a 
robust  new  statutory  list  of  consumer  protection  requirements—although  many  of  these 
requirements mirror the approach that the Agency has taken to program implementation since the 
Adjustable Block Program’s initial development.  The Agency’s approach for implementing these 
consumer protection requirements can be found in Chapter 9.   
Tenth,  under  Section  1-75(c)(1)(N),  the  Plan  “may  consider  whether  community  renewable 
generation projects utilizing technologies other than photovoltaics should be supported through 
State-administered incentive funding, and may issue requests for information to gauge market 
demand.”  The Agency’s prior efforts in this regard demonstrated scant interest in non-solar 
community renewable generation project development (at least without significantly higher REC 
prices),44 but with statutory changes to the definition of community renewable generation projects 
found in Section 1-10 of the IPA Act raising the minimum size of participating projects from 2 MW to 
5 MW, the Agency is curious whether this change could spark renewed interest.  Additional 
discussion can be found in Chapter 7.   
 
42 The Agency understands that P.A. 102-0662’s edits to Section 1-75(c)(1)(J) concerning HVDC converter stations are merely clarifying 
edits, and not intended to create any exception to this subparagraph’s prohibition against utilizing RECs from rate-based projects.

26,34,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Eleventh, the Long-Term Plan must define “procedures established by the Agency” through which 
project labor agreements, now required for new utility-scale wind and solar and brownfield site 
photovoltaic projects participating in IPA procurements pursuant to Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q)(2) of the 
Act, “shall be filed with the Director.”45  This project labor agreement requirement is described in 
more detail within Chapter 5 discussing competitive procurements.    
Twelfth, through new Section 1-75(c)(1)(R) of the Act, the Agency must now “establish a self-direct 
renewable portfolio standard compliance program for eligible self-direct customers that purchase 
renewable energy credits from utility-scale wind and solar projects through long-term agreements 
for purchase of renewable energy credits” through its Long-Term Plan.  As the establishment of an 
entirely new program requires the development of significant amount of new Plan content, the 
Agency has devoted an entire chapter to this new large customer RPS self-direct program; that 
content can be found in Chapter 6.  Under that Chapter’s schedule, applications for this new self-
direct program are scheduled to be taken across early 2023 with program participation formally 
beginning for accepted applicants on June 1, 2023.46   
Lastly, and certainly not least, many of the Agency’s new diversity, equity, and inclusion requirements 
are statutorily required to be addressed through the Agency’s Long-Term Plan.  These include the 
“schedule of percentage increases to the minimum equity standards” to increase those standards 
from  10%  to  30%,  and  “requirements  for  ensuring  that  competitive  procurement  processes, 
including utility-scale solar, utility-scale wind, and brownfield site photovoltaic projects” advance 
equity goals, including through “bid application requirements” and “bid evaluation methodology” in 
competitive procurements.47   Under Section 1-75(c-10), the Agency’s next revised Long-Term Plan 
will also require significant new data reporting and potentially revisions to its equity accountability 
system.    
The Agency’s approach for implementing numerous other requirements found in Section 1-75 of the 
IPA Act must also be included in the Long-Term Plan by implication.   
2.5.1.3.  Illinois Solar for All Requirements   
As discussed further below, in recognition that “the State should encourage . . . investment in 
renewable energy resources, including, but not limited to, photovoltaic distributed generation, which 
should benefit all citizens of the State, including low-income households,” Section 1-56 of the IPA Act 
required the creation of  “the Illinois Solar for All Program, which provides incentives for low-income 
distributed generation and community solar projects [. . .] to bring photovoltaics to low-income 
communities in this State.”48  In so doing, the Agency must “include a description of its proposed 
approach to the design, administration, implementation and evaluation of the Illinois Solar for All 
Program”  in  the  Plan  and  “propose  the  Illinois  Solar  for  All  Program  terms,  conditions,  and 
requirements,”49 including REC prices (which may be through a formula).

The Illinois Solar for All Program began accepting project applications on May 15, 2019.  A more 
comprehensive description of the Agency’s Illinois Solar for All Program, including any revisions 
made thereto, can be found in Chapter 8.    
In addition to describing what the Illinois Solar for All Program is and how it will be administered, 
the  law  also  requires  that,  should  the  IPA  hire  a  third-party  program  administrator  (or 
administrators) to assist with the administration of the Illinois Solar for All Program, the Plan shall 
identify how often that administrator must report to the Agency and the Commission (provided that 
interval is at least quarterly).  The Plan shall also provide for an independent evaluation of the 
program.   
The Plan must also ensure that the Illinois Solar for All program is funded.  Specifically, Section 1-
75(c)(1)(O) of the Act now provides that the Plan “shall allocate up to $50,000,000 per delivery year 
to fund the programs, and the plan shall determine the amount of funding to be apportioned to the 
programs identified in subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of this Act.”  The IPA understands that the 
intention of this language in Section 1-75(c)(1)(O) is this “up to $50,000,000” is additive to whatever 
may be allocated in a given year through the RERF.   
Notwithstanding the language discussed in the paragraph above, the law also requires that “[f]or the 
delivery years beginning June 1, 2021, June 1, 2024, June 1, 2027, and June 1, 2030 and [sic] additional 
$10,000,000 shall be provided to the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to 
implement the workforce development programs and reporting as outlined in Section 16-108.12 of 
the Public Utilities Act.”50  This constitutes a change from the regime in place prior to the enactment 
of P.A. 102-0662, which allocated those funds to ComEd for workforce development programs.   
Additional Illinois Solar for All requirements to be outlined in this Plan include the specific level of 
job trainee required to be used on ILSFA projects; a report on the “progress and barriers to 
participation of small and emerging businesses in the Illinois Solar for All Program”; consideration of 
“additional  program  and  contract  requirements  to  ensure  faithful  compliance  by  applicants 
benefiting from preferences for projects designated to promote energy sovereignty”; reporting on 
efforts to encourage “cross-participation” between the ABP and ILSFA programs; if warranted, 
additional ILSFA programs that target distinct market segments and “incentives targeted to increase 
the uptake of non-photovoltaic technologies by low-income customers, including energy storage 
paired with photovoltaics”; and a determination as to whether “individual subprograms of the Illinois 
Solar for All Program are better served by a different or separate Program Administrator” from the 
ABP Program Administrator.  Additionally, the Agency must include a plan for the following:  
(A) actions to refer customers from the Illinois Solar for All Program to electric and natural 
gas income-qualified energy efficiency programs, and vice versa, with the goal of increasing 
participation in both of these programs;  
(B) effective procedures for data sharing, as needed, to effectuate referrals between the 
Illinois Solar for All Program and both electric and natural gas income-qualified energy 
efficiency programs, including sharing customer information directly with the utilities, as 
needed and appropriate; and

These and other items are addressed in Chapter 8 of the Plan.    
2.5.2.  Items Not Included in Long-Term Renewable Resource Procurement 
Plan  
While the Plan sets forth the IPA’s proposed approach to meeting the state’s renewable energy 
resource procurement targets, it is not the sole mechanism for facilitating the development of 
renewable energy in Illinois or providing value for the environmental attributes of electricity 
generation.  Thus, many items that may be of interest to readers of this Plan are not directly 
addressed in it.  Below is a non-exhaustive list of those items not addressed in the Plan:   
•  Contracts or tariffs for the sale of energy from renewable energy generating facilities, 
whether  through  bilateral  contracts,  wholesale  market  sales,  community  renewable 
generation bill crediting, or net metering;       
•  Previously  effective  renewable  energy  resource  procurement  obligations  applicable  to 
alternative retail electric suppliers under Section 16-115D of the PUA;   
•  The procurement of zero emission credits from zero emission facilities under Section 1-75(d-
5) of the IPA Act, or carbon mitigation credits from carbon-free energy resources under 
Section 1-75(d-10) of the IPA Act;    
•  Workforce development plans produced by a utility pursuant to Section 16-108.12 of the 
PUA;  
•  Renewable energy generating device installer certification requirements developed pursuant 
to Section 16-128A of the PUA;   
•  Tariff filings or modifications for the collection of funds used by utilities to pay for renewable 
energy credit, zero emission credit, and carbon mitigation credit delivery contracts;  
•  Specific renewable energy generating projects, proposals, or sites, including any municipal, 
county, or state permitting (e.g., actions by Agencies other than the IPA) required;  
•  “Green” or “clean energy” retail supply products marketed and sold by alternative retail 
electric suppliers;    
•  Requirements and processes for the interconnection of new renewable energy generating 
facilities, including projects facilitated by IPA-administered programs and procurements;  
•  Broader decarbonization plans, including the closure of Illinois fossil-based energy facilities; 
•  Energy storage workshops led by the Illinois Commerce Commission;  
•  Integrated grid planning processes, or other attempts to modify the electric distribution 
system; 
•  Beneficial  electrification  initiatives,  electric  vehicle  incentives,  or  electric  vehicle 
infrastructure policy;  
•  Renewable energy access plan development.  
These issues may be of significant interest to the Agency, and in some cases, their presence or 
resolution informed decisions made in this Plan.  However, as they do not fall within the scope and 
jurisdiction of what the IPA may propose and the Commission may approve as part of this Plan, 
specific proposals related to the above-listed topics are not made within this document.

2.5.3.  2022 Long-Term Plan Development and Approval   
A draft Second Revised Long-Term Plan was published on Monday August 16, 2021 (within two years 
of its First Revised Plan’s publishing), but ultimately withdrawn under direction provided by Section 
1-75(c)(1)(A) of the Act through P.A. 102-0662.  Instead, given that P.A. 102-0662’s changes in state 
law were sufficiently extensive to require the development of an entirely new Plan, a new draft Long-
Term Plan was required to be developed and published within 120 days of the effective date of P.A. 
102-0662—by January 13, 2022.  Under the requirements of Section 16-111.5(b)(5)(ii) of the PUA, 
affected utilities and interested parties were allowed 45 days to provide comment, resulting in a 
comment deadline of Monday, February 28, 2022.51   
Forty-one sets of written comments were received on the draft Plan.52  During the comment period, 
the Agency was also required to hold public hearings for receiving public comment on the Plan in the 
service territory of each affected utility.  Given the uncertainty around the ongoing COVID-19 global 
health pandemic, the Agency conducted those public hearings virtually on February 18, 2022 for all 
three affected utility service territories.    
Pursuant to Section 16-111.5(b)(5)(ii), the IPA may then revise its draft 2022 Long-Term Plan based 
upon the comments received.  The filed version of the 2022 Long-Term Plan reflected those revisions 
and was filed on March 21, 2022, 21 days after the February 28, 2022 comment deadline.  
The Commission’s approval of the filed 2022 Long-Term Plan took the form of a docketed proceeding 
conducted pursuant to the Commission’s Rules of Practice.53  The Commission approved the 2022 
Long-Term Plan through its July 14, 2022 Final Order in ICC Docket No. 22-0231; this Final Plan 
reflects revisions necessitated by the Commission’s Final Order in that proceeding (in addition to 
other updates where applicable).    
2.5.4.  Plan Updates  
While the Agency’s long-term renewable resources procurement plan features a “long-term” focus, 
many elements informing future program and procurement decisions—technological progress, 
marketplace changes, the success or failure of work undertaken under a prior-approved approach—
were unknowable at the time of the Initial Plan’s publishing and are still unknowable as of today.   
As described above, the PUA provides that the Agency “shall review, and may revise, the plan at least 
every 2 years” after the Initial Plan, and “shall review and propose any revisions to the long-term 
renewable energy resources procurement plan in conjunction with the Agency's other Section 16-
111.5 planning and approval processes.”54   At present, and absent a statutory change through new 
legislation, the Agency tentatively plans for its next revisions to its Long-Term Renewable Resources 
Procurement Plan to be proposed in 2023, as part of the development and approval process of the 
IPA’s 2024 annual procurement plan.   
The PUA also requires that “the Commission shall hold an informal hearing for the purpose of 
receiving comments on the prior year's procurement process and any recommendations for change” 
 
51 Forty-five days from the date of publication of the draft 2022 Long-Term Plan was February 27, 2022, which falls on a Sunday.  Pursuant 
to the Statute on Statutes, the deadline for comments was February 28, 2022.

on or before July 1 of each year.55  This has taken the form of written recommendations, technical or 
substantive, being submitted to the Commission and posted publicly on the Commission’s website.56   
2.6. The RPS and Percentage-Based Goals of the RPS  
The Illinois RPS is similar to other state renewable portfolio standards, which require that a certain 
percentage of electricity sales be met with a climbing percentage of renewable energy or renewable 
energy credit procurement.  For Illinois, this total is now “40% by 2030, climbing to 50% by 2040.”57   
2.6.1.  Load Applicable to RPS Goals  
Prior to P.A. 99-0906, only “eligible retail customer” load—meaning load associated with utility 
default supply customers, and not customers taking supply through alternative retail electric 
suppliers (“ARES”) or through hourly pricing—was subject to this requirement.  Changes to the RPS 
arising from the enactment of P.A. 99-0906 transitioned renewable goals applicable only to “eligible 
retail customer” load to goals applicable to “all load for retail customers” by the 2019 delivery year, 
and P.A. 102-0662 maintains that approach.   
Certain exceptions exist to this load calculation.  Under Section 1-75(c)(1)(H), if an ARES owned one 
or more renewable generating facilities that were not wind or photovoltaic as of December 31, 2015, 
then that ARES may elect “to supply its retail customers with renewable energy credits from the 
facility or facilities” so long as those facilities continued to be owned by that ARES.  This self-
procurement from ARES-owned facilities thus serves to reduce the statutory renewable energy 
resource  obligation  by  the  number  of  RECs  self-procured.58    Similarly,  successful  customer 
participation through the self-direct RPS compliance program found in Section 1-75(c)(1)(R) of the 
Act  should  result  in  that  retail  customer  load  no  longer  being  subject  to  RPS  procurement 
requirements.        
Further discussion of how these percentage-based multipliers apply to retail customer load to create 
actual REC procurement targets is presented in Chapter 3.  As now expressly required under Section 
1-75(c)(1)(B), “[t]he Agency shall not comply with the annual percentage targets described in this 
subparagraph (B) by procuring renewable energy credits that are unlikely to lead to the development 
of new renewable resources.”59  
Notably, these RPS goals only apply to load served by Illinois’ major electric distribution utilities: 
ComEd,  Ameren  Illinois,  and  that  portion  of  MidAmerican  load  for  which  the  IPA  conducts 
procurements.  The Illinois RPS goals do not apply to load served by municipal electric utilities, rural 
electric cooperatives, or Mt. Carmel Public Utility Company, and those entities do not have renewable 
energy procurement obligations under Illinois law.

2.6.2.  Eligible Projects for the Illinois RPS  
Not all renewable energy generating facilities are eligible to sell RECs into the Illinois RPS.  Changes 
made through P.A. 99-0906 significantly narrowed the universe of facilities capable of generating 
RECs which qualify for the RPS, and those changes were largely kept intact through P.A. 102-0662.  
Specific criteria applicable to RECs or facilities producing those RECs are discussed further below.   
2.6.2.1.  Eligible Generating Technologies  
The Illinois Power Agency Act’s definition of “renewable energy resource” as set forth in Section 1-
10 provides that the underlying energy must be generated “from wind, solar thermal energy, 
photovoltaic cells and panels, biodiesel, anaerobic digestion, crops and untreated and unadulterated 
organic waste biomass, and hydropower that does not involve new construction or significant 
expansion of hydropower dams, waste heat to power systems, or qualified combined heat and power 
systems” as well as “landfill gas produced in the State.”  The IPA understands that only those 
generating technologies delineated in the definition may qualify.60  Through P.A. 102-6662, this 
definition now also expressly includes “high voltage direct current renewable energy credits and the 
associated energy converted to alternating current by a high voltage direct current converter station 
to the extent that: (1) the generator of such renewable energy resource contracted with a third party 
to transmit the energy over the high voltage direct current transmission facilities, and (2) the third-
party contracting for delivery of renewable energy resources over the high voltage direct current 
transmission facilities have ownership rights over the unretired associated high voltage direct 
current renewable energy credit.”61    
The Act also sets forth certain generating technologies categorically incapable of producing RECs 
eligible for the Illinois RPS, which include “the incineration or burning of tires, garbage, general 
household, institutional, and commercial waste, industrial lunchroom or office waste, landscape 
waste, railroad crossties, utility poles, or construction or demolition debris, other than untreated and 
unadulterated waste wood.”62    
These requirements are merely threshold requirements for a REC’s technical eligibility for the Illinois 
RPS; specific programs, such as the Adjustable Block Program, and specific outlined procurement 
targets carry additional limitations on eligible generating technology.  Thus, while Public Act 102-
0662 expanded the definition of “renewable energy resource” to include technologies such as waste 
heat to power systems (“WHP”) and qualified combined heat and power systems (“CHP”), Section 1-
75(c) of the IPA Act contains no language authorizing program or procurement activity to procure 
RECs from WHP and CHP systems.63  Instead, Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) establishes targets only for the 
procurement of RECs from “new wind and solar projects” with an express objective for “the goals in 
subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (1)” – the percentage-based RPS goals – be “met entirely by 
procurements  of  renewable  energy  credits  from  new  wind  and  photovoltaic  projects.”    As  a 
 
60 The Agency understands that hydropower facilities featuring new turbines added to existing non-hydropower dams would not be eligible 
to participate as these facilities would constitute a newly constructed “hydropower” dam, and would thus be prohibited under Section 1-
10 of the IPA Act’s limitation of eligible hydropower only to “hydropower that does not involve new construction or significant expansion 
of hydropower dams.”

63 These changes to the definition of “renewable energy resource” may nevertheless be impactful in other contexts.  For example, by 
expressly including CHP and WCP technologies in Section 1-10’s definition of “renewable energy resources,” RECs from those systems may 
be eligible for use by retail electric suppliers for “green” or “renewable” retail supply offers to Illinois businesses and residents.

consequence, this Plan seeks the procurement of RECs only from wind and photovoltaic projects, 
while  also  exploring  a  Request  for  Information  process  around  non-PV  or  wind  community 
renewable generation projects under Section 1-75(c)(1)(N)’s express authorization that the Agency 
“may consider whether community renewable generation projects utilizing technologies other than 
photovoltaics should be supported through State-administered incentive funding.”        
2.6.2.2.  Eligible Projects—Locational 
Under the regime introduced by P.A. 99-0906 through Section 1-75(c)(1)(I), a generating facility’s 
RECs are no longer prioritized based on location; instead, the facility either qualifies for the Illinois 
RPS, or it does not.   Outside of language specific to RECs associated with electricity transmitted to 
qualifying Illinois-based high voltage direct current converter stations, this approach was maintained 
through P.A. 102-0662.   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) provides that the Plan must be designed “to maximize the State's interest in the 
health, safety, and welfare of its residents, including but not limited to minimizing sulfur dioxide, 
nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and other pollution that adversely affects public health in this 
State, increasing fuel and resource diversity in this State, enhancing the reliability and resiliency of 
the electricity distribution system in this State, meeting goals to limit carbon dioxide emissions under 
federal or State law, and contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment for the citizens of this 
State.”  While the statute determines that a facility located in-state provides those benefits at a 
sufficient level, the Agency also “may qualify renewable energy credits from facilities located in states 
adjacent to Illinois if the generator demonstrates and the Agency determines that the operation of 
such facility or facilities will help promote the State's interest in the health, safety, and welfare of its 
residents” based on this public interest criteria.  As the law provides no discussion of potentially 
qualifying facilities located in states not “adjacent to Illinois,” facilities located in those states 
generally cannot produce RECs for satisfying the Illinois RPS.      
The Agency’s discussion of how to apply these criteria to adjacent state facilities, as well as a listing 
of which states are considered “adjacent” to Illinois, can be found in Chapter 4.   
2.6.2.3.  Eligible Projects—Cost Recovery  
Through Section 1-75(c)(1)(J), RECs from “a generating unit whose costs were being recovered 
through rates regulated by this State or any other state or states on or after January 1, 2017” are also 
considered non-compliant with the Illinois RPS.  The statute’s stated rationale behind this prohibition 
is to “promote the competitive development of renewable energy resources in furtherance of the 
State's interest in the health, safety, and welfare of its residents.”   
In application, the Agency understands this limitation does not apply to municipal utilities or rural 
cooperatives that effectively serve as vertically-integrated utilities (as even insofar as they can 
achieve full cost recovery for the development of renewable energy generating facilities through 
rates, their rates are in most cases still not regulated by “this state or any other state or states”),64 but 
would still apply to non-electric utilities (e.g., water, gas, telecommunications) regulated by the 
Illinois Commerce Commission or by another state for which rate recovery could be sought for a 
photovoltaic system participating in the Illinois RPS.

The law also offers more punitive consequences if a non-regulated rate facility becomes a regulated 
rate facility after the execution of an Illinois RPS contract.  In such a situation, the contract must be 
terminated and “the supplier of the credits must return 110% of all payments received under the 
contract,” with those payments then being used for the procurement of additional RECs from new 
wind or photovoltaic generation in the Agency’s next procurement event. 65  Since the passage of P.A. 
99-0906,  contracts  developed  for  the  Agency’s  programs  and  procurements  have  contained 
provisions reflecting this penalty.   
The Agency’s approach to these issues is discussed in Chapter 4.    
2.6.2.4.  Installer & Labor Requirements  
Certain facilities seeking to participate in the RPS are also subject to an installer qualification 
requirement.  Specifically, RECs from “new photovoltaic projects or new distributed renewable 
energy generation devices [. . .] must be procured from devices installed by a qualified person in 
compliance with the requirements of Section 16-128A of the Public Utilities Act and any rules or 
regulations adopted thereunder.”66   
In  Docket  No.  17-0268,  the  Illinois  Commerce  Commission  adopted  its  Title  83,  Part  461 
administrative rules for the installation of new utility-scale photovoltaic generating projects under 
Section 16-128A of the PUA.  In that proceeding, the Commission adopted the following definition for 
the term “qualified person” for new utility-scale solar installations:   
""Qualified  person""  means  a  person  who  performs  installations  on  behalf  of  the 
certificate holder and who has completed at least one of the following programs 
requiring lab or field work and received a certification of satisfactory completion: an 
apprenticeship as a journeyman electrician from a USDOL-registered or an applicable 
state-agency-registered  electrical  apprenticeship  and  training  program;  a  North 
American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) distributed generation 
technology  certification  program;  an  electrical  training  program  for  in-house 
employees  established  and  administered  by  an  electric  utility  regulated  by  the 
Commission; or an Associate in Applied Science degree from an Illinois Community 
College Board-approved community college program in solar generation technology.67 
The Part 461 rules also provide a definition of the term “install”:   
""Install""  means  to  perform  the  electrical  wiring  and  connections  necessary  to 
interconnect the new solar project with the electric utility's transmission or distribution 
system at the point of interconnection between the project and the utility. ""Install"" in 
this Part specifically does not mean: 
•  Electrical wiring and connections to interconnect the new solar project 
performed by utility workers;

468 as Distributed Generation Installers.

performed by the manufacturer; 
•  The on-site construction and installation of a solar panel or a collector 
substation; or

performed  by  individuals  such  as  an  inspector,  management  planner, 
consultant,  project  designer,  or  contractor  for  the  project  or  their 
employees. 
Definitions of these terms were initially approved by the Commission in a Second Notice Order on 
August 25, 2017 and approved with modification by the state’s Joint Committee on Administrative 
Rules (“JCAR”) on October 24, 2017 with an effective date of October 26, 2017.   
Any  parties  seeking  to  develop  new  photovoltaic  projects  in  Illinois  should  be  aware  of  the 
Commission’s Part 461 rules (governing installers of utility-scale photovoltaics) and Part 468 rules 
(governing distributed generation installers) and certification process more generally.   
Through the addition of new Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q)(1) of the Act under P.A. 102-0662, most new 
projects supported under the Illinois RPS must also now meet Prevailing Wage Act requirements 
including, but not limited to, paying the prevailing wage to workers engaged in the construction of 
new renewable energy facilities.  Exceptions to these requirements exist for “houses of worship” 
where aggregated co-located project capacity would not exceed 100 kilowatts and “projects that 
serve single-family or multi-family residential buildings.”  Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iv)(ii) provided an 
additional exemption for previously-waitlisted Large DG ABP projects in the ABP reopening prior to 
the publication of this Plan.  Additional information on the IPA’s approach to ensuring Prevailing 
Wage Act compliance can be found in Chapter 7.     
Under Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q)(2) of the Act, new utility-scale wind, utility-scale solar, and brownfield 
site photovoltaic produced RECs must also “be from facilities built by general contractors that must 
enter into a project labor agreement, as defined by this Act, prior to construction.”  Section 1-10 of 
the Act defines a project labor agreement as “a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement that covers 
all terms and conditions of employment on a specific construction project,” and outlines specific 
elements required to be included in that agreement:  
(1) provisions establishing the minimum hourly wage for each class of labor organization 
employee; 
(2) provisions establishing the benefits and other compensation for each class of labor 
organization employee; 
(3) provisions establishing that no strike or disputes will be engaged in by the labor 
organization employees; 
(4) provisions establishing that no lockout or disputes will be engaged in by the general 
contractor building the project; and 
(5) provisions for minorities and women, as defined under the Business Enterprise for 
Minorities, Women, and Persons with Disabilities Act, setting forth goals for apprenticeship 
hours to be performed by minorities and women and setting forth goals for total hours to 
be performed by underrepresented minorities and women.

Project labor agreements must be filed with the Agency Director and must “provide the names, 
addresses, and occupations of the owner of the plant and the individuals representing the labor 
organization employees participating in the project labor agreement consistent with the Project 
Labor Agreements Act,” as well as specifying “the terms and conditions as defined by this Act.”  A 
labor organization and the general contractor building the project shall have the authority to include 
other terms and conditions as they deem necessary.  Additionally, as proposed by the IPA in Docket 
No. 22-0231 and affirmed by the Commission in approving the Plan, project labor agreement 
submittals must also include a description of the efforts the entity will take or has taken to achieve 
such goals, including recruitment of minorities and women into apprenticeship roles.68   
Additional information on the submission of project labor agreements for projects participating in 
the IPA’s competitive procurements can be found in Chapter 5.     
2.6.3.  Compliance Mechanism: RECs vs. “Renewable Energy Resources”  
An additional change to the Illinois RPS originally made through P.A. 99-0906 and maintained 
through P.A. 102-0662 was a focus on the use of only RECs as the compliance mechanism for meeting 
Illinois renewable energy procurement targets.  Prior to P.A. 99-0906, Section 1-75(c) required 
renewable energy procurement targets to be met through the procurement of “renewable energy 
resources”—either a REC, or the REC and its underlying energy.  While most IPA procurement 
activities focused only on the procurement of RECs, the 2010 long-term power purchase agreements 
are 20-year contracts for the delivery of a “bundled” REC and energy product.   
Rather than using the term “renewable energy resources,” Section 1-75(c)(1)(B) requires that the 
Plan “shall include the goals for procurement of renewable energy credits”69 to meet the statute’s 
targets.  Focusing only on “RECs” makes intuitive sense: while the IPA now conducts renewable 
energy planning and procurement processes to meet goals and targets applicable to all retail 
customer load,70 its energy procurements still focus only on eligible retail customer load—thus 
creating a disconnect between the universes of supply requirements served by these two exercises.       
Over time, the IPA has become aware of concerns held by developers of utility-scale renewable 
energy  projects  that  there  may  be  a  shallow  market  for  long-term  bilateral  energy  off-take 
agreements for geographically-qualifying new projects, which developers believe are necessary for 
providing the revenue certainty required for financing new facility construction.  The Agency 
understands  that  these  concerns  informed  changes  to  the  REC  pricing  structure  for  projects 
supported under competitive procurements found in Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(v) of the Act, with a shift 
to an Indexed REC pricing structure under which, as wholesale energy prices fall, REC prices rise 
commensurately—and vice versa.  By allowing bidders to bid in a “strike price” reflecting both 
required REC and energy revenues, the Agency understands that this model—if interpreted and 
implemented in a manner faithful to the spirit of ensuring that project developers are made whole at 
that strike price—will functionally serve the same end as a bundled REC and energy contract for 
 
68 See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 7.

70 Specifically, the IPA’s long-term renewable resources procurement plan shall include renewable resource procurement for 100% of 
retail customer load beginning with the delivery year beginning June 1, 2019, after procuring for an increasing portion of retail customer 
load for the prior two delivery years.  See 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(B).

developers of new utility-scale wind and solar projects and their financiers.  This new Indexed REC 
price structure is described in more detail in Chapter 5.     
2.6.4.  RPS Funding and Rate Impact Cap  
The  procurement  of  renewable  energy  credits  is  limited  by  an  annual  procurement  budget 
established through a rate impact cap.  Specifically, “the total of renewable energy resources 
procured under the procurement plan for any single year . . . shall be reduced for all retail customers 
based on the amount necessary to limit the annual estimated average net increase due to the costs of 
these resources included in the amounts paid by eligible retail customers in connection with electric 
service to no more than 4.25% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the 
year  ending  May  31,  2009.”71    This  amount  then  “shall  be  applied  to  the  actual  amount  of 
kilowatthours of electricity delivered, or applicable portion of such amount [. . .] by the electric utility 
in the delivery year immediately prior to the procurement to all retail customers in its service 
territory.”  This produces an annual REC procurement budget for the “costs of those resources” in a 
given year.72    
Through the budgets established under the rate impact cap and the associated tariffs for the 
collection of funds, the applicable electric utility “shall be entitled to recover all of its costs associated 
with the procurement of renewable energy credits” under the Plan, including “associated reasonable 
expenses for implementing the procurement programs, including, but not limited to, the costs of 
administering and evaluating the Adjustable Block program.”73  As a result, annual procurement 
budgets  based  only  on  REC  costs  would  be  inaccurate,  and  some  estimate  of  associated 
administrative expenses must be included and taken into account.   
Through changes introduced by P.A. 102-0662, Section 16-108(k) of the PUA now require utility 
tariffs, which authorize funding collection for the RPS, to allow for a given delivery year’s unspent 
budget amounts to be “rolled over” for later delivery years’ expenditures.  Rather than requiring the 
refund of any unspent amounts, Section 16-108(k) now provides that RPS collections in a given year 
“may be spent by the utility for the procurement of renewable resources over any of the following 5 
delivery years,” with first priority in expenditure assigned to “money collected in earlier delivery 
years that has not yet been returned to customers.”  Relatedly, additional changes to Section 16-
108(k) ensure that any amounts eligible for refund “shall be reduced by an amount equal to the 
payment obligations required by any contracts entered into by an electric utility . . . even if such 
payments have not yet been made and regardless of the delivery year in which those payment 
obligations were incurred.”  The Agency believes that these new safeguards should help ensure that 
the full amount of collections authorized under Section 1-75(c)(1)(E) are ultimately leveraged to 
support new renewable energy project development and should help address the RPS budget “cliff” 
problems experienced across 2021.  Further discussion of how these changes impact the Agency’s 
annual estimates of RPS budgets can be found in Chapter 3.   
 
71 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(E). 
72 The exception referenced above in Section 1-75(c)(1)(H) serves to reduce available budgets, as “the charges that would otherwise be 
applicable to the retail customers of the alternative retail electric supplier . . .  shall be reduced by the ratio of the quantity of renewable 
energy credits supplied by the alternative retail electric supplier compared to that supplier's target renewable energy credit quantity.”  
Similarly, bill crediting under Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)’s large customer self-direct RPS compliance program serves to reduce available 
budgets as well.

2.7. Quantitative New Build Targets of the RPS   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(B) of the IPA Act provides percentage-based umbrella goals for RECs required to 
be procured based on a percentage of applicable retail customer load.  But within those umbrella 
requirements more specific requirements must also be met—and indeed prioritized above those 
percentage-based goals.   
One such requirement is the procurement of RECs from “new wind projects” and “new photovoltaic 
projects” found in Section 1-75(c)(1)(C).  Rather than expressed as a percentage of load, these 
requirements are expressed on a quantitative basis (i.e., a statutorily-defined minimum number of 
RECs delivered annually) while still counting toward the overall renewables percentage-based 
procurement goals.     
2.7.1.    Quantitative Procurement Requirements  
As modified by P.A. 102-0662, Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)(i) establishes aggressive new targets for the 
quantity of RECs procured from “new” solar and wind projects: “10,000,000 renewable energy 
credits delivered annually by the end of the 2021 delivery year, and increasing ratably to reach 
45,000,000 renewable energy credits delivered annually from new wind and solar projects by the 
end of delivery year 2030.”  The relative proportions of those amounts are 45% from wind projects 
and 55% from photovoltaic projects.  Of the photovoltaic project portion, the Agency shall procure 
“at least 50%” from the Adjustable Block Program, “at least 47%” from utility-scale solar projects, 
and “at least 3%” from non-community solar brownfield site photovoltaic projects.   
Consistent with RPS implementation across 2017-2021, the Agency interprets this “at least 50%” 
concept to be in terms of RECs (as opposed to budget or installed capacity), and out of the 
quantitative target amounts listed in the law—and not necessarily 50% of the overall number of RECs 
procured.  In Docket No. 17-0838 approving the IPA’s Initial Long-Term Plan, the Illinois Commerce 
Commission  authorized  utility-scale  photovoltaic  procurements  resulting  in  significantly  more 
utility-scale photovoltaic RECs under contract than the Adjustable Block Program could possibly 
sustain given budget limitations, further reinforcing that these proportions are intended to establish 
minimum amounts of totals rather than proportionate overall percentages.            
The  Agency  has  made  meaningful  progress  toward  meeting  these  totals  through  prior  RPS 
procurement activity from “new” projects, with millions of RECs already under contract to be 
delivered annually from new wind and new photovoltaic projects.  Further discussion of this progress 
can be found in Chapter 3 of this Plan, while the Agency’s discussion of competitive procurements for 
meeting these targets can be found in Chapter 5.   
2.7.2.  “New wind project” and “new photovoltaic project” Definition  
The statute provides definitions of a “new wind project” and a “new photovoltaic project.” A “new 
photovoltaic project” is a “photovoltaic renewable energy facilit[y] that [is] energized after June 1, 
2017.”74  Projects developed under Section 1-56 of the IPA Act (i.e., supplemental photovoltaic and 
Illinois Solar for All projects) are not eligible to meet quantitative “new photovoltaic project” 
targets.75

38,46,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
The definition of a “new wind project” was revised through P.A. 102-0662.  Previously, Section 1-
75(c)(1)(C)(iii) defined new wind projects” as “wind renewable energy facilities that are energized 
after June 1, 2017 for the delivery year commencing June 1, 2017 or within 3 years after the date the 
Commission approves contracts for subsequent delivery years.”76  Through P.A. 102-0662, the 
underlined phrasing of “within 3 years after the date…” has been stricken from statute, thus no longer 
establishing a minimum delivery timeline requirement for a project to be considered “new”.  The IPA 
thus  now  understands  that  the  “new  wind  project”  definition  essentially  mirrors  the  “new 
photovoltaic project” definition, with the “for the delivery year commencing June 1, 2017” remaining 
within that definition referring to each delivery year thereafter as well (as, otherwise, there would 
be no applicable definition for a “new wind project”).   
Both  definitions  raise  the  question  of  what  constitutes  a  facility  being  “energized.”    Unlike 
interconnection, where official approval is required and associated forms are produced and executed 
on a specific date, “energized” is more nebulous and, unfortunately, not defined through the law.  
Faced with a similar quandary in developing its Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurement Plan, the 
Agency settled on a definition of “energized” as being “the date by which the System has been turned 
on for a period of 24 consecutive hours and is operational for purposes of generating electricity 
regardless of whether the system has registered with a REC tracking system.” Parties could then 
substantiate a system’s energization through a certification accompanied by the submission of 
various forms establishing a system’s energization timeline. The Agency notes that unlike the 
Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurement process, in which payment for RECs was made after REC 
generation and only upon delivery and invoice to the Agency, the Adjustable Block Program and the 
Illinois Solar for All Program feature prepayment for some, or all, of the RECs from a system upon 
energization. Therefore, as discussed in Chapters 7 and 8, consideration is also given to a system 
being  registered  in  a  tracking  system  to  generate  RECs  in  addition  to  the  date  on  which 
interconnection to the utility was approved.     
2.7.3.  Forward Procurements Conducted Outside of This Plan 
Independent of (and, in some cases, prior to) the development of the Initial Plan, P.A. 99-0906 
required the IPA to conduct “initial forward procurements” of RECs from “from new utility-scale wind 
projects” and “from new utility-scale solar projects and brownfield site photovoltaic projects.”77  
Conducted  through  competitive  procurement  processes  subject  to  applicable  requirements  of 
Section 16-111.5 of the PUA, the Initial Forward Procurement sought 15-year REC delivery contracts 
set to begin delivery on June 1, 2019 at the earliest and—initially—June 1, 2021 at the latest (that 
deadline has since been extended to June 1, 2022 through Public Act 101-0113 in the case of certain 
development risks).  For both wind and solar, the targeted overall REC procurement quantities were 
1,000,000 RECs delivered annually from each generating technology, with a single wind procurement 
event required to take place within 160 days of June 1, 2017 and the solar procurement potentially 
conducted across multiple procurement events up to one year from June 1, 2017.78  
In a similar manner, Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iii) required that the Agency “conduct at least one 
subsequent forward procurement for renewable energy credits from new utility-scale wind projects, 
new utility-scale solar projects, and new brownfield site photovoltaic projects within 240 days” after

event was May 13, 2022—well before the Commission’s deadline for approval of this Plan.  The 
procurement quantity for this “subsequent forward procurement” is “quantities necessary to meet 
the requirements of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) through the delivery year beginning June

procurement could not be made through this Plan from a timing standpoint, they are outside of the 
scope of the Plan.    
Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(i) and (ii) of the Act expressly provide that RECs procured through the Initial 
Forward  Procurement  “shall  be  included  in  the  Agency's  Long-Term  Renewable  Resources 
Procurement Plan and shall apply to all renewable energy goals”79 found in Section 1-75(c) of the IPA 
Act, including the quantitative “new wind” and “new photovoltaic” targets discussed above.  While 
not expressly stated, the same must be true for those procurement events conducted pursuant to 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iii), as those procurements are required to be sized so as to meet Section 1-
75(c)(1)(C)’s  requirements.    The  Agency’s  procurement  quantities  for  the  initial  forward 
procurements and for this pre-Plan/post-P.A. 102-0662 subsequent forward procurement event are 
reflected in Chapter 5.       
New Section 1-75(c-5) of the Act also requires the Agency to “conduct procurement events . . . of 
renewable energy credits from new renewable energy facilities to be installed at or adjacent to the 
sites of electric generating facilities that, as of January 1, 2016, burned coal as their primary fuel 
source” and meet other specified criteria (including the development of on-site storage projects).   
While this “coal-to-solar” procurement is not covered by this Long-Term Plan, RECs procured by 
Illinois electric utilities serving more than 300,000 customers through REC delivery contracts 
resulting from coal-to-solar procurements “may be included or counted for purposes of compliance 
with the amounts of renewable energy credits required to be procured” pursuant to Section 1-75(c) 
“to the extent that there are otherwise shortfalls in compliance with such requirements.”  Additional 
information about the coal-to-solar procurement process can be found on the IPA Procurement 
Administrator’s website: https://www.ipa-energyrfp.com/coal-to-solar/.       
2.7.4.  Competitive Procurements Proposed Through This Plan  
To meet the aggressive targets set forth by Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) of the Act for wind, utility-scale 
solar, and brownfield site photovoltaic projects, additional procurement events will need to be 
scheduled in the years ahead.   
RECs under contract from Subsequent Forward Procurements are included in tables found in Chapter 
3, while further discussion of competitive procurement events including any proposed Subsequent 
Forward Procurements can be found in Chapter 5.     
2.7.4.1.  Indexed REC Price Structure  
Changes to Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(v) of the Act enacted through P.A. 102-0662 now require that “for 
all competitive procurements and any procurements of renewable energy credit [sic] from new

40,48,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
utility-scale wind and new utility-scale photovoltaic projects,” an Indexed REC price structure must 
be used.  Under this structure, bidders offer a “strike price” defined as “a contract price for energy 
and renewable energy credits,” akin to an all-in price for RECs and energy.  Under the Indexed REC 
pricing structure, a resulting REC price constitutes “the difference resulting from subtracting the 
strike price from the index price for that settlement period,” with the index price representing “the 
real-time energy settlement price at the applicable Illinois trading hub.”  Under the law, “[i]f this 
difference results in a negative number, the [buyer] shall owe the seller the absolute value multiplied 
by the quantity of energy produced in the relevant settlement period.”  But [i]f this difference results 
in a positive number, the seller shall owe the [buyer] this amount multiplied by the quantity of energy 
produced in the relevant settlement period.”80  
Thus, if real-time energy settlements yielded a $40 energy settlement price, the resulting REC price 
under a contract featuring a $45 strike price would be $5 per REC for that settlement period.  
However, if real-time energy settlements yielded a $50 energy settlement price, a $45 strike price 
would result in a $5 per REC payment from Seller (the bidder in competitive procurements) back to 
the Buyer (the counterparty electric utility).  To ensure that prices remain predictable and affordable, 
the Agency may also propose a price collar through this Plan to place boundaries around REC price 
volatility.   
The Agency understands this new Indexed REC pricing approach to offer revenue certainty back to 
renewable energy project developers in a manner that functions similarly to a bundled fixed price 
REC + energy off-take agreement.  In times when energy revenues are low, REC prices are high; in 
times when energy revenues are high, REC prices adjust downward accordingly.  The end result is 
revenue certainty regardless of wholesale energy market conditions, hopefully solving financing and 
development barriers for entities seeking to develop new utility-scale wind and utility-scale solar 
projects under the Illinois RPS.   
Additional discussion of the Indexed REC price structure is presented in Chapter 5.   
2.7.4.2.  Bid Evaluation in Competitive Procurements  
P.A.  102-0662  includes  two  new  provisions  that  may  impact  bid  evaluation  in  competitive 
procurement events.  Section 1-75(c)(1)(P) requires the Agency to develop “a method to optimize 
procurement of renewable energy credits from proposed utility-scale projects that are located in 
communities eligible to receive Energy Transition Community Grants pursuant to Section 10-20 of 
the  Energy  Community  Reinvestment  Act.”    Under  the  Energy  Community  Reinvestment  Act, 
communities eligible to receive Energy Transition Community Grants must meet one or more of the 
following criteria:  
(1) the area contains a fossil fuel or nuclear power plant that was retired from service or 
has significantly reduced service within 6 years before the application for designation or 
will be retired or have service significantly reduced within 6 years following the application 
for designation;

41,49,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
(2) the area contains a coal mine that was closed or had operations significantly reduced 
within 6 years before the application for designation or is anticipated to be closed or have 
operations significantly reduced within 6 years following the application for designation; or 
(3) the area contains a nuclear power plant that was decommissioned, but continued 
storing nuclear waste before the effective date of this Act. 
If  the  need  to  optimize  selection  of  projects  in  Energy  Transition  Community  Grant  eligible 
communities “conflicts with other provisions of law,” or if the IPA determines that compliance “would 
be unreasonably costly or administratively impractical,” the Agency may a) propose alternative 
approaches to achieve the same ends or b) seek an exemption from this requirement from the ICC, 
presumably through this Plan approval process.  Additional discussion of this Energy Transition 
Community Grant optimization requirement can be found in Chapter 5.    
Section 1-75(c-10)(3) requires that, through this  Plan, the Agency “develop requirements  for 
ensuring that competitive procurement processes, including utility-scale solar, utility-scale wind, 
and brownfield site photovoltaic projects, advance the equity goals” of subsection (c-10).  To comply 
with this Section 1-75(c-10)(3) objective, the Agency must “develop bid application requirements 
and a bid evaluation methodology for ensuring that utilization of equity eligible contractors . . . is 
optimized.”   Application requirements may include requiring “that winning or successful applicants 
for utility-scale projects are or will partner with equity eligible contractors,” while bid evaluation 
may require “giving preference to bids through which a higher portion of contract value flows to 
equity eligible contractors.”  Additional discussion of competitive procurements can be found in 
Chapter 5, while the Agency’s approach to implementation of subsection (c-10) can be found in 
Chapter 10.    
2.7.4.3.  Alternatives for Brownfield Site Photovoltaic Projects 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)(i) now authorizes the Agency to “consider other approaches, in addition to 
competitive procurements, that can be used to procure renewable energy credits from brownfield 
site photovoltaic projects.”  The Agency understands this language to allow for a shift away from 
competitive procurements and to an alternative structure – whether through a fixed-price, open-
enrollment program akin to the Adjustable Block Program; an application process with qualitative 
criteria utilized to score projects similar to how community-driven community solar operates; or 
something  else  altogether  –  to  award  REC  delivery  contracts  to  proposed  brownfield  site 
photovoltaic projects.  Further discussion of this language is found in Chapter 5; for purposes of this 
first Plan developed pursuant to P.A. 102-0662, and especially in light of the changes offered through 
the shift to an Indexed REC pricing structure, this Plan will continue utilization of competitive 
procurements for supporting brownfield site photovoltaic projects.  Future plans may then evaluate 
the success of the competitive procurement approach relative to “other approaches” and propose 
modifications to this model.    
2.8. Adjustable Block Program & Community Renewable Generation   
As referenced above, at least 50% of the quantitative new photovoltaic project target found in Section 
1-75(c)(1)(C) of the IPA Act shall be procured “from solar photovoltaic projects using the program 
outlined in subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1) from distributed renewable energy generation 
devices or community renewable generation projects”—i.e., using the Adjustable Block Program.

42,50,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
2.8.1.  Adjustable Block Program  
At its core, the Adjustable Block Program is perhaps most notable for what it is not: it is not a 
“competitive procurement event” using “pay as bid” pricing with selection of bids based on price, as 
discussed in the Section above.  Nor is it a project selection process through which the winning bidder 
is determined by public interest criteria, such as those set forth in Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) or used in 
the selection of winning bids under the Zero Emission Standard found in Section 1-75(d-5) or under 
the Carbon Mitigation Credit procurement found in Section 1-75(d-10) of the Act.   
Instead, the Adjustable Block Program provides “a transparent annual schedule of prices and 
quantities to enable the photovoltaic market to scale up and for renewable energy credit prices to 
adjust at a predictable rate over time.”81  Stated differently, a party seeking a REC contract—such as 
a photovoltaic distributed generation or community solar project developer—knows the REC price 
in advance and generally when and how that price may change.   
The law sets forth other requirements of the Adjustable Block Program: it must include “a single block 
of nameplate capacity, a price for renewable energy credits within that block, and the terms and 
conditions for securing a spot on a waitlist once the block is fully committed or reserved.”82  Each 
block constitutes a quantity of nameplate capacity with a REC price83 attached to that block.  Through 
changes made via P.A. 102-0662, transitions between blocks now occur on an annual basis, rather 
than through one block opening automatically at a different price after the prior block’s capacity is 
filled.   
Thus, “for each category” (of which there are now six) and “for each delivery year,” the Agency is 
required to determine “the amount of generation capacity in each block, and the purchase price for 
each block”—with those blocks priced and sized to ensure that Section 1-75(c)’s REC procurement 
goals are met.    
Pursuant to Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iv) of the Act as modified by P.A. 102-0662, the Adjustable Block 
Program reopened for REC delivery contract awards and the receipt of new project applications on 
December 14, 2021—90 days after the effective date of P.A. 102-0662.  Decisions made for ABP 
reopening occurred outside of this Planning process and are not outlined here.  To the extent those 
decisions are memorialized as program requirements on a going-forward basis, those requirements 
are further discussed in Chapter 7.   
2.8.1.1.  Adjustable Block Program—Projects  
Even with six separate project categories, the Adjustable Block Program broadly supports only two 
project types: photovoltaic distributed renewable energy generation devices (i.e., solar DG), and 
photovoltaic community renewable generation projects (i.e., community solar84).    
Under Illinois law, a photovoltaic distributed renewable energy generation device must be:    
 
81 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(K). 
82 Id. 
83 Prices can be a set value, or established as the product of a formula.   
84 There are other forms of community solar recognized by Illinois law, including (A) properties owned or leased by multiple customers 
that contribute to the operation of an eligible renewable electrical generating facility, and (B) individual units, apartments, or properties 
located in a single building that are owned or leased by multiple customers and collectively served by a common eligible renewable 
electrical generating facility.  220 ILCS 5/16-107.5(l)(1).  These forms of community solar are not eligible for the Adjustable Block Program.

(1) Powered by photovoltaics;    
(2) interconnected at the distribution system level of either an electric utility as defined in this 
Section,  a  municipal  utility  as  defined  in  this  Section  that  owns  or  operates  electric 
distribution facilities, or a rural electric cooperative as defined in Section 3-119 of the Public 
Utilities Act (and thus, must be located in Illinois to be interconnected to such an entity); 
and         
(3) located on the customer side of the customer's electric meter and is primarily used to offset 
that customer's electricity load.85   
In preparing this Plan, the Agency received inquiries from representatives of public university 
“utilities” (which also serve as retail customers of electric utilities) about whether a distributed 
renewable energy device technically interconnected to that university utility system, but offsetting 
the electricity load from a university building that would otherwise need to be purchased by the 
university as a distribution customer of an electric utility, would qualify for the Adjustable Block 
Program.  Under the Illinois Commerce Commission’s Order in Docket No. 22-0231,  assuming the 
public university is indeed a retail customer of an electric utility (or otherwise takes retail electric 
service from a municipal utility or rural electric cooperative), a system interconnected in this manner 
may qualify for the Adjustable Block Program under the above definition.86   
Under Illinois law, a photovoltaic community renewable generation project is a generation facility 
that:  
(1) is powered by photovoltaics;  
(2) is interconnected at the distribution system level of an electric utility as defined in this 
Section,  a  municipal  utility  as  defined  in  this  Section  that  owns  or  operates  electric 
distribution facilities, a public utility as defined in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act, or 
an electric cooperative, as defined in Section 3-119 of the Public Utilities Act (and thus, must 
be located in Illinois to be interconnected to such an entity); 
(3) credits the value of electricity generated by the facility to the subscribers of the facility; and 
(4) is limited in nameplate capacity to less than or equal to 5,000 kilowatts.87 
Only new projects—those “energized on or after June 1, 2017”—are eligible for the Adjustable Block 
Program.   
More specifically, in terms of what project types participate at what level within the Adjustable Block 
Program, the ABP now provides for six separate project categories at the following levels:   
(1) At least 20% from distributed renewable energy generation devices with a nameplate 
capacity of no more than 25 kilowatts;  
(2) At least 20% from distributed renewable energy generation devices with a nameplate 
capacity of more than 25 kilowatts and no more than 5,000 kilowatts;88

(3) At least 30% from photovoltaic community renewable generation projects;89 
(4) At least 15% from distributed renewable generation devices or photovoltaic community 
renewable generation projects installed at public schools;90   
(5) At least 5% from community-driven community solar projects intended to provide more 
direct and tangible connection and benefits to the communities which they serve or in which 
they operate and, additionally, to increase the variety of community solar locations, models, 
and options in Illinois;  
(6) At least 10% from distributed renewable energy devices with a nameplate capacity under 
5,000 kilowatts or photovoltaic community renewable generation projects submitted by 
applicants that are equity eligible contractors.91 
Over time, the Agency shall propose to increase the percentage in the equity eligible contractor 
category to 40% based on factors including the number of equity eligible contractors and capacity 
used in that category in previous delivery years.  That 40% is achieved through a commensurate 
reduction in the percentage shares applicable to other categories.    
Should any given category not be fully subscribed within a given year, the Agency is now required to 
redistribute that capacity by giving priority to those categories featuring waitlisted projects.  The REC 
price applicable to those projects supported by redistributed capacity is required by law to be the 
price applicable to that subsequent year (and not the prior year in which waitlisted projects may 
have originally applied).   
Additional information on project qualification for these categories, including definitions and criteria 
applicable  to  “public  schools,”  “community-driven  community  solar,”  and  “equity  eligible 
contractors,” can be found in Chapter 7. That Chapter also outlines what selection criteria will be 
applied to select community-driven community solar projects.   
The law also provides that the Adjustable Block Program shall ensure that RECs are procured from 
“projects in diverse locations and are not concentrated in a few geographic areas.”92  The Agency has 
spent  time  reviewing  the  geographic  distribution  of  projects  supported  thus  far  through  the 
Adjustable Block Program and has found that the Program generally features very strong geographic 
diversity.  Some exceptions certainly exist – for instance, while community solar projects facilitated 
through the program look well-dispersed on a map of the state, development has almost exclusively 
occurred in less populated rural areas featuring lower land cost – but the IPA has generally been 
pleased with the degree to which the tens of thousands of projects supported to date through the 
Adjustable Block Program more broadly demonstrate geographic diversity.    
Moving  forward,  the  Agency  commits  to  continue  monitoring  the  locations  of  proposed  and 
completed projects.  The Agency publishes a map on its Adjustable Block Program website providing 
a visual display of project location by zip code,93 and in recognition of increased interest in

process  for  publishing  additional  information  on  project  location.    Further  discussion  of  the 
geographic diversity of Adjustable Block Program projects is found in Chapter 7.   
2.8.1.2.  Adjustable Block Program—Contracts  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(L) sets forth certain requirements applicable to REC delivery contracts entered 
into  through  the  Adjustable  Block  Program,  with  those  requirements  having  been  modified 
extensively through P.A. 102-0662.  In accordance with changes in law and depending on ABP 
category, the delivery term for a REC delivery contract may now be 15 years or 20 years in length.  
As the Buyer counterparty, payment for RECs is made by (and RECs are delivered to) the applicable 
electric utility (which must then retire the RECs), and payment must occur according to the following 
schedule:   
•  For DG systems of no more than 25 kW, the full contract value “shall be paid in full, based on 
the estimated generation during the first 15 years of operation” upon verification by the 
Program Administrator of energization.94  The contract length (delivery term) of these 
contracts is 15 years.95    
•  For both large DG systems (more than 25 kW but less than 5MW) and community-driven 
community solar projects, 15% of the contract value shall be paid upon verification of 
energization by the program administrator, with the remaining portion “paid ratably over 
the subsequent 6-year period.  The contract length (delivery term) of these contracts is 
likewise 15 years.96   
•  For both the non-community driven (traditional) community solar projects and public school 
projects, “the renewable energy credit delivery contract length shall be 20 years and shall be 
paid over the delivery term, not to exceed during each delivery year the contract price 
multiplied by the estimated annual renewable energy credit generation amount.”97  This 
“paid-upon-delivery” structure resembles utility-scale contracts more so than prior ABP 
contracts.   
•  For the equity eligible contractor category, the payment terms applicable to the category in 
which the system would otherwise fall generally apply.  For example, a Small DG system 
participating in the equity equitable contractor block would receive a 15-year REC delivery 
contract with full payment upon energization.  However, contracts under the equity eligible 
contractor category may also feature a payment structure through which “applicant firms are 
advanced capital disbursed after contract execution but before the contracted project's 
energization” based on a demonstration of qualification or need.98  This capital advancement 
would not serve to increase the overall contract value, but would allow prepayment of a share 
of  expected  contract  revenues  to  assist  with  predevelopment  activities.    Qualification 
 
94 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(L)(ii). The Agency understands this provision to mean that a system of exactly 25 kW in size would be included 
in this category. 
95 All prepayment remains subject to the amounts collected by the utilities under its Section 16-108(k) tariffs, however, and other available 
funds (such as alternative compliance payments).  (See Section 1-75(c)(1)(L)(vii)).

requirements for pre-energization capital and the amount or percentage of pre-energization 
capital available to qualified applicants is outlined in Chapter 7.    
Prepayment poses unique challenges.  While RECs are required to be delivered when generated to 
meet annual utility compliance obligations, prepayment reduces the incentive to actually deliver 
RECs.  On this point, the law requires that each contract “shall include provisions to ensure the 
delivery of the estimated quantity of renewable energy credits and ongoing collateral requirements 
and other provisions deemed appropriate by the Agency.”99  
This Plan’s approach to Adjustable Block Program contracts generally, as well as to the clawback 
provisions, collateral requirements and other contract elements intended to ensure REC delivery, can 
be found in Chapter 7.   
2.8.1.3.  Adjustable Block Program—Midstream Changes  
Unlike a competitive procurement process, through which changes in market conditions may be 
reflected in bidders’ bids, the Adjustable Block Program requires that the Agency project future 
market conditions through establishing annual block sizes and prices.   
The law envisions these changes occurring in two ways: first, the Agency “may periodically review 
its prior decisions establishing the amount of generation capacity in each block, and the purchase 
price for each block, and may propose, on an expedited basis, changes to these previously set values” 
subject to the Section 16-111.5 plan revision process.100   
Second, “[p]rogram modifications to any block price that do not deviate from the Commission's 
approved value by more than 10% shall take effect immediately and are not subject to Commission 
review and approval.”101  To prevent the requirement that the Agency seek formal administrative 
approval for large modifications from being effectively ignored, the Agency believes this threshold 
should be understood as a 10% change based on the last formally approved (i.e., through revision of 
the Plan via Commission’s Section 16-111.5 approval process) price for that particular annual block.   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(M) of the Act requires that the Agency “consider stakeholder feedback when 
making adjustments to the Adjustable Block design” and “notify stakeholders in advance of any 
planned change.”  Likewise, the law requires that “[t]he Agency and its consultant or consultants shall 
monitor block activity, share program activity with stakeholders and conduct quarterly meetings to 
discuss program activity and market conditions.”  In implementing the program, the Agency has to 
date attempted to seek stakeholder feedback for the development of key program requirements or 
new  forms  and  documents;  such  documents  are  published  on  the  program  website 
(www.illinoisabp.com) and new requirements are incorporated into the Adjustable Block Program 
Guidebook.102  The program website also features a program dashboard updated daily to provide 
stakeholders with daily data on block activity,103 project information spreadsheets to provide

2.8.1.4.  Adjustable Block Program—Consumer Protection 
In its Initial Plan, the Agency proposed and the Commission approved several consumer protection 
measures constituting terms, conditions, and requirements for the receipt of state-administered 
incentive funds under the Adjustable Block Program and Illinois Solar for All Program.  The Agency 
then developed an Approved Vendor registration and approval process, standardized disclosure 
forms,  a  standardized  program  brochure,  minimum  contract  requirements,  and  marketing 
requirements across 2017 and 2018, with those items updated periodically since.   
Revisions made to Section 1-75(c)(1)(M) of the Act now memorialize, reinforce, and expand the 
Agency’s consumer protection responsibilities.  In addition to those items proposed through this 
Long-Term Plan or developed thereafter, these new-to-statute terms, conditions, and requirements 
include the following:  
(i) A registration process for entities seeking to qualify for program-administered incentive 
funding and baseline qualifications for vendor approval, with a list of approved entities on 
each program's website.  The agency may also revoke a vendor's ability to receive program-
administered incentive funding upon a determination that the vendor failed to comply with 
contract terms, the law, or other program requirements. 
(ii) Program requirements and minimum contract terms to ensure projects are properly 
installed and produce their expected amounts of energy, including on-site inspections and 
photo documentation.  The Agency may require repairs, alterations, or additions to remedy 
any material deficiencies discovered, and bar Approved Vendors with a disproportionately 
high number of deficient systems from program participation. 
(iii) Standardized disclosures to a customer prior to that customer's execution of a contract 
for the development of a distributed generation system or a subscription to a community 
solar project. 
(iv) Establishment of Consumer Complaints Centers to accept complaints connected with 
the programs and a public database of complaints. 
(v) An annual written report to the ICC documenting the frequency and nature of complaints 
and any enforcement actions taken in response to those complaints. 
(vi) Regular meetings with the Office of the Attorney General, the ICC, consumer protection 
groups, and other interested stakeholders regarding consumer protection matters.  
(vii) Referrals of complaints to the Office of the Attorney General, the Illinois Commerce 
Commission, or local, State, or federal law enforcement where appropriate. 
As  the  requirement  to  establish  these  consumer  protection  items  applies  to  the  “program 
administrators for both the Adjustable Block program and the Illinois Solar for All Program,” the 
Agency understands these items to be minimum statutory consumer protection requirements

applicable to the Illinois Solar for All Program as well.  The additional requirements found in Section 
1-56(b)  for  ILSFA  projects,  sites,  applicants,  and  customers  create  consumer  protection 
requirements for the Illinois Solar for All Program beyond those applicable to the ABP.   
2.8.2.  Community Renewable Generation Projects  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(N) as modified by P.A. 102-0662 requires that the Agency “establish the terms, 
conditions, and program requirements for photovoltaic community renewable generation projects 
with a goal to expand renewable energy generating facility access to a broader group of energy 
consumers, to ensure robust participation opportunities for residential and small commercial 
customers and those who cannot install renewable energy on their own properties.”106  While only 
solar  community  renewable  generation  projects  are  supported  through  the  Adjustable  Block 
Program,  Section  1-75(c)(1)(N)  allows  the  IPA  to  “consider  whether  community  renewable 
generation projects utilizing technologies other than photovoltaics should be supported through 
State-administered incentive funding” and the Agency “may issue requests for information to gauge 
market demand.”   
Additional considerations applicable to community renewable generation projects and subscriptions 
are outlined below.   
2.8.2.1.  Portability and Transferability of Subscriptions   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(N) provides that “subscriptions” to community renewable generation projects 
must be portable (i.e., retained by the subscriber even if the subscriber relocates within the same 
utility service territory) and transferable (i.e., a subscriber may assign or sell subscriptions to 
another person within the same utility service territory).   
During the implementation of the Adjustable Block Program, some entities have raised questions 
regarding the scope of the portability and transferability of community solar subscriptions.  It seems 
clear that the law did not envision completely unconditional portability or transferability: if a 
resident holding a community solar subscription were to move from a large house to a small 
apartment, the resultant drop in energy consumption may necessitate downsizing the subscription.  
Likewise, a transferee may be an unworkable recipient of an existing subscriber’s community solar 
subscription for many reasons, from being legally ineligible (outside of that utility’s service territory) 
to posing a more significant non-payment risk than the transferor.  At the same time, allowing 
unbounded Approved Vendor-imposed restrictions on portability or transferability could defeat the 
spirit of the law’s requirement that subscriptions be portable and transferable.   
Through revisions to Section 1-75(c)(1)(N) provided by P.A. 102-0662, the law clarifies that these 
concepts shall be “subject to reasonable limitations.”  As additional projects energize and begin to 
cycle through subscribers, the Agency hopes to learn more about what considerations should inform 
the parameters of portability and transferability requirements.   
2.8.2.2.  Opt-Out Municipal Aggregation  
Certain stakeholders have raised the question of whether community renewable generation project 
subscriptions (specifically, community solar subscriptions) may be eligible for execution via opt-out 
 
106 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(N). 
48 
 ",2. Statutory Requirements of the Plan ,[],626,18,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
49,57,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
municipal aggregation authorized under Section 1-92 of the IPA Act.  Under opt-out municipal 
aggregation, municipalities (after passing authorizing referenda) may aggregate their residential and 
small commercial customer load and contract with an alternative retail electric supplier to supply 
those customers with “energy and related services” at a negotiated supply rate unless that customer 
expressly chooses to “opt-out” of the transaction.    
For the IPA, in its role as the entity charged with administering the Adjustable Block Program and 
Illinois Solar for Program, this raises, at minimum, two questions:  
First, is the enrollment of a customer into a subscription for a community solar project without their 
direct authorization or consent (i.e., on an “opt-out” basis) legally authorized by Section 1-92 of the 
IPA Act’s governmental aggregation provisions?   
Second, even if legally authorized, would that relieve Approved Vendors from program-related 
responsibilities with respect to individual subscribers, including the requirement that each customer 
complete a disclosure form acknowledging participation in the program?   
As to the first question, the IPA is highly skeptical that opt-out municipal aggregation could legally 
cover community solar subscriptions, which were not contemplated anywhere in Illinois law when 
Section 1-92 was enacted via Public Act 96-0176 in 2009 (and notes that countless implementation 
issues would be raised under such an approach).107  However, only the second of these questions falls 
within the scope of this Plan.  On that question, the Agency’s disclosure form requirements discussed 
above,  and  now  expressly  required  under  changes  to  Section  1-75(c)(1)(M)  of  the  Act,  are 
fundamental to subscribers receiving standardized information.  Those requirements constitute the 
backbone of the Agency’s efforts to deliver uniform content about the rights and obligations under a 
ratepayer-funded  program  to  everyday  citizens.    That  standardized  information  and  express 
acknowledgment by a subscriber is an essential form of education that must be provided to each 
individual participant to produce a transparent, positive experience in IPA programs.  Thus, even if 
some colorable argument could be made that community solar subscribers could be enrolled without 
each individual subscriber providing direct consent to a given subscription, the Agency would not 
waive its program-specific consumer protection requirements—including its standardized brochure 
and the receipt and execution of a disclosure form.   
In Docket No. 19-0995, the Illinois Commerce Commission agreed, determining that any community 
solar subscription aggregation program (if legally possible) for a project participating in the ABP or 
ILSFA would be required to ensure that every individual subscriber receives and executes an 
individualized standard disclosure form.108  The Commission likewise agreed with the Agency that 
the question of whether opt-out municipal aggregation for community solar subscriptions is legally 
authorized under Section 1-92 of the IPA Act is an issue outside the scope of Plan approval, finding 
that “this proceeding is not the forum for the Commission to decide the legality of opt-out municipal 
aggregation for community solar subscriptions, as numerous interested stakeholders - such as the 
 
107 Any community renewable generation project that does not participate in an IPA-administered program or procurement may freely 
operate outside of this Plan’s requirements. However, given the Agency’s express statutory role (separate from its role administering 
renewable resources programs under this Plan) assisting governmental aggregation programs under Section 1-92(g) of the Act, the 
Agency’s perspective should carry advisory authority.

many municipalities that might be interested and the private brokers that might assist them in 
soliciting bids - would not be on notice that the issue is being decided.”109   
2.9. Illinois Solar for All Program 
As described in Section 1-56(b) of the IPA Act, the Illinois Solar for All Program “provides incentives 
for low-income distributed generation and community solar projects, and other associated approved 
expenditures” in order “to bring photovoltaics to low-income communities in this State in a manner 
that maximizes the development of new photovoltaic generating facilities, to create a long-term, low-
income solar marketplace throughout this State, to integrate, through interaction with stakeholders, 
with existing energy efficiency initiatives, and to minimize administrative costs.”  Further, the 
program shall be “designed to grow the low-income solar market.”110   
The Program shall also “maximize efficiencies and synergies available through coordination with 
similar initiatives, including the Adjustable Block program . . . energy efficiency programs, job 
training programs, and community action agencies.”  The Agency shall strive to ensure that support 
is provided to “projects across the breadth of low-income and environmental justice communities in 
Illinois, including both urban and rural communities,” and “not concentrated in a few communities” 
or excluding any “particular low-income or environmental justice communities.”   
A statutory overview of the Illinois Solar for All Program (which began accepting project applications 
on May 15, 2019), as well as the individual sub-programs under the Illinois Solar for All banner, is 
below.       
2.9.1.  Illinois Solar for All—Overview  
At its core, the Illinois Solar for All Program is an incentive program—through more generous REC 
prices, the Illinois Solar for All Program incents low-income (as well as non-profit and public facility) 
participation in solar photovoltaic projects, whether as a system owner, community solar project 
subscriber, or system host.  Those RECs are retired by the counterparty Buyer (either the Agency or 
a utility) to satisfy Section 1-75(c) compliance obligations just as with the other procurements and 
programs  described  above,  while  the  additional  premium  helps  grow  the  low-income  solar 
marketplace and ensure more equitable access to the benefits of clean energy.  Thus, structurally, the 
law envisions the Solar for All Program’s incentive being offered through contracts for the delivery 
of  RECs  at a  premium price,  supplying  the  higher  incentive  necessary to  ensure  low-income 
participation. The Agency also may offer full contract prepayment or otherwise relax (or enhance) 
requirements in recognition of the unique challenges facing low-income project development.   
While the program features no hard targets or goals for the quantity of RECs procured, it does feature 
defined funding sources.  First, Illinois Solar for All is funded through the Renewable Energy 
Resources Fund.  At the time of finalization of this Plan (August 2022), the balance of the RERF was 
$128.9 million. The $108.5 million balance of funds that had been transferred to the state’s General 
Revenue Fund ($98.5 million) and Health Insurance Reserve Fund ($10 million) for liquidity 
purposes was fully repaid by late March 2022.  The IPA considers any contractual obligations from 
the RERF pre-dating Illinois Solar for All (specifically, Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurement 
contracts) to be senior to any new obligations entered into through the Illinois Solar for All

Program,111 and as of August 2022, approximately $2.5 million in such prior obligations remain 
outstanding.112  No additional Alternative Compliance Payments are due to be made into the RERF.   
Second, Illinois Solar for All is funded through a portion of funds collected by the utilities under their 
Section 16-108(k) RPS tariffs for purchases made under Section 1-75(c) of the IPA Act.  Under Section 
1-75(c)(1)(O) as revised by P.A. 102-0662, the Plan “shall allocate up to $50,000,000 per delivery 
year to fund the programs, and the plan shall determine the amount of funding to be apportioned to 
the programs.”  This $50 million cap constitutes a nearly five-fold increase from the utility collections 
previously authorized to support the ILSFA Program.   For the delivery years beginning June 1, 2021, 
June 1, 2022, and June 1, 2023, that total amount may be reached by averaging, such that a lower 
budget in an earlier year could be made up for through a larger budget in a later year.  Every three 
years,  an  additional  $10,000,000  shall  also  be  provided  to  DCEO  to  implement  workforce 
development programs authorized under Section 16-108.12 of the PUA; this also constitutes a 
change, as that funding had previously been allocated to ComEd for those programs (and on four-
year intervals).   
Under the Illinois Solar for All Program, payments “shall be in exchange for all renewable energy 
credits generated by the system during the first 15 years of operation and shall be structured to 
overcome barriers to participation in the solar market by the low-income community.”113 The 
contract “may pay for such renewable energy credits through an upfront payment per installed 
kilowatt of nameplate capacity paid once the device is interconnected at the distribution system level 
of the interconnecting utility and verified as energized,” giving the Agency flexibility in proposing 
contract structures.114   
The counterparty to Illinois Solar for All contracts executed using RERF funds is the Agency, while 
the counterparty to contracts executed using utility funds is the applicable utility.   
While the Act does not require an annual RERF budgetary allocation to ILSFA, the Agency continues 
to propose to allocate funds and consider project applications based on “program years,” which track 
the same period of time as energy delivery years (June 1st of one year to May 31st of the following 
year). The Agency’s budget allocations by program year are described in detail in Chapter 8. 
In addition to payments for REC delivery contracts, the law provides that “[t]he Agency shall direct 
up to 5% of the funds available under the Illinois Solar for All Program to community-based groups 
and other qualifying organizations to assist in community-driven education efforts related to the 
Illinois Solar for All Program.”  Authorized grassroots education activities include “general energy 
education, job training program outreach efforts,” and “other activities deemed to be qualified by the 
Agency,” but “shall not be used to support the marketing by solar project development firms and 
organizations, unless such education provides equal opportunities for all applicable firms and 
organizations.”115  Notably, for grassroots education efforts this amount is not based only on the 
 
111 This appears to be the intent evident in Section 1-56(b) as well, as that section prefaces the percentage-based allocation of RERF funds 
with the qualifier “monies available in the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resources Fund and not otherwise committed to 
contracts executed under subsection (i) of this Section.” (emphasis added)   
112 Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurement contracts were for the delivery of RECs for 5 years, with payment for RECs made upon delivery; 
the procurement’s original budget was $30 million.

balance of the RERF; it is instead “up to 5% of the funds available under the Illinois Solar for All 
Program,” and thus also inclusive of any Section 1-75(c) or 16-108(k) funds.  In implementation, the 
Agency has decided to award grassroots education contracts through a competitive RFP process, with 
those entities serving as subcontractors to the Agency’s Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator 
and performing grassroots education activities under that master contract.116   
In addition to grassroots education, “costs associated with procuring experts, consultants, and the 
program administrator . . . and related incremental costs, costs related to income verification and 
facilitating customer participation in the program, and costs related to the evaluation of the Illinois 
Solar for All Program” may be paid out of the RERF.117  New proposals for how best to leverage 
grassroots education funding for solving barriers to ISLFA participation can be found in Chapter 8.    
2.9.2.  Illinois Solar for All—Sub-programs  
Illinois Solar for All is designed to support specific defined project types, and to this end, Illinois Solar 
for All features four sub-programs with percentage-based funds allocations applicable to each.  As 
clarified through P.A. 102-0662, these percentages apply to both support from the RERF and from 
utility collections, although these allocations are merely initial percentages and may be altered “if the 
Agency, after receiving input through a stakeholder process,” determines that any individual sub-
program has not been adequately subscribed to fully utilize ILSFA funds.   
For the purposes of this Plan subsection, an individual sub-program may be referred to as a 
“program” (as is done within Section 1-56(b)(2) of the Act) or a “sub-program” (which is more 
intuitive, as these programs are programs within the Illinois Solar for All Program).  Regardless of 
verbiage, each constitutes an initiative operating inside the Illinois Solar for All Program structure 
and is subject to its general requirements, including Approved Vendor qualification requirements, 
but with separate program year budgets and project application requirements  
In addition to these four sub-programs, the Agency or a party may propose additional sub-programs 
through this Long-Term Plan.  Such new programs “may target market segments not specified above 
and may also include incentives targeted to increase the uptake of nonphotovoltaic technologies by 
low-income  customers,  including  energy  storage  paired  with  photovoltaics”—but  only  if  “the 
Commission determines that the Illinois Solar for All Program would provide greater benefits to the 
public health and well-being of low-income residents through also supporting that additional 
program versus supporting programs already authorized.”118 
Through P.A. 102-0662, the Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Project Program was struck from 
Section 1-56(b) (previously subparagraph (D)), while a new Low-Income Large Multifamily Solar 
Incentive Program took its place (within subparagraph (E)).  REC delivery contracts, program 
requirements, and statutory requirements applicable to projects having successfully participated 
under subparagraph (D) remain in effect, but the Agency may no longer conduct additional Low-
Income Community Solar Pilot Project procurements.

2.9.2.1.  Low-Income Single-Family and Small Multifamily Solar Incentive  
The Low-Income Single-Family and Small Multifamily Solar Incentive sub-program “provide[s] 
incentives to low-income customers, either directly or through solar providers, to increase the 
participation of low-income households in photovoltaic on-site distributed generation at residential 
buildings containing one to 4 units.”119  Used for this sub-program and others, the term “solar 
provider” has no definition in the statute; to allow the market to determine appropriate models, the 
Agency has determined that “solar providers” can refer to any entity which has a contractual 
relationship with the low-income customer in connection with the underlying photovoltaic system 
(whether in the form of purchase, leasing, installation, aggregation, or financing).   
The law also requires that “an administrator shall facilitate partnering the companies that install 
solar panels with entities that provide solar panel installation job training.”120  The IPA understands 
this to mean its third-party Program Administrator engaging in such facilitation, and this is presently 
part of the ILSFA Program Administrator’s scope of work.   
The IPA Act also includes a provision that “[c]ontracts entered into under this paragraph may be 
entered into with an entity that will develop and administer the program.”121 It is unclear how the 
administrator could leverage state funds for this use, and at present, all such contracts will be entered 
into between Approved Vendors (Sellers) and the State of Illinois or a participating utility (Buyers).   
Through P.A. 102-0662, this sub-program also now contains extensive support for projects that 
demonstrate  energy  sovereignty    (see  Section  2.9.3.3  below),  which  is  intended  to  support 
“ownership of projects by low-income households, not-for-profit organizations providing services to 
low-income households, affordable housing owners, community cooperatives, or community-based 
limited liability companies providing services to low-income households” that “ensure that local 
people have control of the project and reap benefits from the project over and above energy bill 
savings.”  Program and contract requirements may be developed to ensure faithful compliance with 
these objectives by entities benefitting from additional energy sovereignty support (whether through 
reserved program capacity or higher REC prices).  Additional discussion of energy sovereignty can 
be found below, in Chapter 8, and in Appendix G.   
The Agency shall also “make every effort” to ensure that ABP solar providers can “easily participate 
in this program.”  According to Section 1-56(b)(2)(A)(ii) such efforts could include “utilizing similar 
or  the  same  application  systems  and  processes,  similar  or  the  same  forms  and  formats  of 
communication, and providing active outreach to companies participating in one program but not 
the other.”  The Agency’s strategies for encouraging increased participation in the two low-income 
distributed generation sub-programs can be found in Chapter 8.   
Along with the Low-Income Large Multifamily Solar Incentive Program, these two sub-programs are 
allocated 35% of available funds.

2.9.2.2.  Low-Income Community Solar Project Initiative  
Through the Low-Income Community Solar Project Initiative, “[i]ncentives shall be offered to low-
income customers, either directly or through developers, to increase the participation of low-income 
subscribers of community solar projects.”122  Again, the term “developer” is undefined in the law.  As 
community  solar  project  subscriptions  may  be  actively  marketed  by  entities  other  than  the 
photovoltaic project “developers,” no guidance is provided as to whether this phrasing is intended to 
include all entities marketing such subscriptions or only the project’s actual developer.  
The program requires that each participating project’s developer “shall identify its partnership with 
community stakeholders regarding the location, development, and participation in the project.”123  
Undefined in this phrasing is what constitutes a “community stakeholder,” or whether the project 
itself must include “community stakeholders” from the community in which the project is located 
(presumably so), the community of any subscribers (unclear), or both (also unclear).   
Pre-P.A. 102-0662 statutory language stating that “[i]ncentives should also be offered to community 
solar projects that are 100% low-income subscriber owned, which includes low-income households, 
not-for-profit organizations, and affordable housing owners” has been struck from the law and 
replaced by energy sovereignty language found elsewhere Section 1-56(b)(2);124 the Agency’s 
approach to energy sovereignty under the ILSFA Program is discussed more extensively below, in 
Chapter 8, and in Appendix G.     
The law also provides that “[c]ontracts entered into under this paragraph may be entered into with 
developers,”125 which the IPA has interpreted to mean that a project developer, upon a sufficient 
showing of low-income participation, may qualify for a contract award.   
This sub-program is allocated 40% of available funding.     
2.9.2.3.  Incentives for Non-profits and Public Facilities         
The third Illinois Solar for All sub-program provides that funding “shall be used to support on-site 
photovoltaic distributed renewable energy generation devices to serve the load associated with not-
for-profit customers and to support photovoltaic distributed renewable energy generation that uses 
photovoltaic technology to serve the load associated with public sector customers taking service at 
public buildings.”126  Stated differently, the program operates similarly to the first sub-program—an 
incentive  for on-site  DG  through a  higher-priced  REC contract—only  with  different  eligibility 
requirements  (not-for-profit  customers  and  public  sector  customers  taking  service  at  public 
buildings).   
This limited statutory guidance raises the question of whether all non-profits and all public sector 
entities may qualify for the sub-program, or whether some nexus with the broader “low-income” 
intent of Illinois Solar for All is required.  As discussed further in Chapter 8, the IPA believes that

some level of community involvement may be required to maintain consistency with the spirit of the 
law.127     
This sub-program also combines referenced elements of each of the prior programs, stating that 
“[c]ontracts may be entered into with an entity that will develop and administer the program or with 
developers,”128 which carries similar challenges to those referenced above.      
This sub-program is allocated 25% of available funding.     
2.9.2.4.  Low-Income Large Multifamily Solar Incentive   
The fourth sub-program, now outlined through subparagraph (E) to Section 1-56(b), is the Low-
Income Multifamily Solar Incentive.  This sub-program provides incentive funding “to low-income 
customers, either directly or through solar providers, to increase the participation of low-income 
households in photovoltaic on-site distributed generation at residential buildings with 5 or more 
units.”  This new sub-program in one sense replaces the Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Project 
program previously offered under subparagraph (D), but can also be viewed as an expansion of the 
previous Low-Income Distributed Generation Incentive program—with that program now split into 
two separate sub-programs for residential projects (one single family/small multifamily; one large 
multifamily).   
Additional requirements applicable to this new multifamily building subprogram include job trainee, 
energy sovereignty, and environmental justice community requirements discussed further below.    
Along with the Low-Income Single Family and Small Multifamily Solar Incentive Program outlined in 
subparagraph (A), these two sub-programs are allocated 35% of available funds.   
2.9.3.  Illinois Solar for All—Additional Requirements  
Section 1-56(b) also provides that, under Illinois Solar for All, “[e]ach contract that provides for the 
installation of solar facilities shall provide that the solar facilities will produce energy and economic 
benefits, at a level determined by the Agency to be reasonable, for the participating low income 
customer.”129  The Agency believes that this requirement is in part met through the premium attached 
to the REC price under Illinois Solar for All (and “energy benefits” for community solar and 
distributed generation projects are already handled though bill crediting and net metering provisions 
over which the Agency lacks jurisdiction), and provides support for consumer protections to ensure 
that low income customers indeed receive benefits in entering into contractual arrangements with 
installers, project developers, aggregators, or other intermediaries.  Those specific requirements are 
discussed in more detail in Chapters 8 and 9.   
Illinois Solar for All contracts must also “ensure the wholesale market value of the energy is credited 
to participating low-income customers or organizations,”130 which, again, is an issue handled through 
net metering, but can be emphasized in resulting contracts.  Contracts must also ensure that “tangible 
economic benefits flow directly to program participants, except in the case of low-income multi-

family housing where the low-income customer does not directly pay for energy.”131 While the law 
does not define “tangible economic benefit” (or, for that matter, a “program participant”), the Agency 
will continue to require, consistent with the Commission Order approving the Initial Plan,132 that 
ongoing annualized payments by the customer (if any) must be less than 50% of the annual first year 
estimated production and/or utility default service net metering value to be received by the 
customer.  The tangible benefits language also provides further reason to ensure that marketing 
practices are standardized such that low-income customers receive clear, standardized information 
about the benefits to be expected from an Illinois Solar for All project.       
The law also directs that priority to be given to projects that “demonstrate meaningful involvement 
of low-income community members in designing the initial proposal.”133 Here again, the law provides 
no definition of “meaningful involvement” nor does it define a “low-income community member,” 
and it is unclear whether this would be distinct from an “environmental justice community” or what 
constitutes  a community  “member.” The  law  further  provides  that “[a]cceptable  proposals  to 
implement projects must demonstrate the applicant's ability to conduct initial community outreach, 
education,  and  recruitment  of  low-income  participants  in  the  community;”  again,  the  term 
“participants in the community” is undefined and entirely unclear, but the Agency does understand 
this  language  as  providing  that  entities  seeking  to  market  installations  or  community  solar 
subscriptions using Illinois Solar for All contracts must, at a minimum, be certified by the Agency and 
possess some baseline level of demonstrated competency.  The Agency’s approach to vendor 
certification through its Approved Vendor process is discussed further in Chapters 7 and 8.     
2.9.3.1.  Environmental Justice Communities  
All four sub-programs also contain “a goal . . . that a minimum of 25% of the incentives for this 
program be allocated to community photovoltaic projects in environmental justice communities.”134  
Through changes to Illinois law made by P.A. 102-0662, other programs and state agencies now rely 
on this “environmental justice community” definition for their determinations of program and 
funding eligibility.   
The Agency’s definition of the term “environmental justice community” is discussed further in 
Chapter 8 and, at present, is described more comprehensively on the Illinois Solar for All website, 
which allows for users to search qualification status by address.135      
2.9.3.2.  Trainee Requirements  
As growing the low-income solar market involves more than just REC delivery contracts making 
photovoltaics more affordable, the law also requires that projects “include job training opportunities 
if available,” and provides that such job training opportunities should occur through coordination 
with the job training programs proposed in the Workforce Development Plan produced through 
Section 16-108.12 of the PUA and through the Energy Transition Act.

Through P.A. 102-0662, Section 1-56(b)(2) now requires that, for all sub-programs, “the specific level 
of trainee usage” is to be determined through the Long-Term Plan.  Previously, a baseline minimum 
level of trainee usage applied only to the Low-Income Distributed Generation subprogram; through 
this change the IPA understands Section 1-56(b)(2) to now require minimum trainee usage levels for 
all four sub-programs (with the availability for waivers where appropriate), and not only for the 
subprogram referenced within subparagraph (A) (the scope of which has itself now changed).      
The Agency’s approach to encouraging that projects use job trainees to help build the low-income 
solar marketplace is discussed further in Chapter 8.     
2.9.3.3.  Energy Sovereignty   
New language found throughout Section 1-56(b)(2) is intended to encourage participation from 
more project proposals which demonstrate “energy sovereignty,” which is not defined by the statute.  
Express language requiring support for projects that facilitate energy sovereignty can be found in 
subparagraphs (A), (B), and (E); subparagraph (C) includes language about necessary safeguards 
through program and contract requirements, but not specific language about providing support for 
projects demonstrating energy sovereignty  (and  from a  public  policy  perspective,  the energy 
sovereignty concept would appear to be a less acute concern for non-profits and public facilities).   
As the Agency understands it, the primary objective in providing dedicated support for projects that 
promote energy sovereignty is to ensure wealth-building for low-income communities.  Energy 
sovereignty allows program participants to access project benefits above and beyond the financial 
savings and other direct benefits that more detached participation may offer to low-income Illinois 
residents.  Section 1-56(b)(2) envisions two primary means for promoting energy sovereignty: 1) 
dedicated portions of a sub-program budget reserved for projects that promote energy sovereignty; 
and  2)  heightened incentive  levels  (i.e.,  higher REC  prices) for  projects  that  promote  energy 
sovereignty.  Given the full prepayment model used for ILSFA REC delivery contracts coupled with 
the reality that accomplishing energy sovereignty may entail confirmation of progress well after the 
project’s energization, certain subparagraphs within Section 1-56(b)(2) also expressly reference 
“additional  program  and  contract  requirements  to  ensure  faithful  compliance”  with  energy 
sovereignty standards.   
Appendix G contains an analysis of the energy sovereignty concept, including what businesses 
models could be utilized to accomplish energy sovereignty and how those and other models may 
work  within  individual  ILSFA  sub-programs.    Additional  discussion  of  energy  sovereignty 
requirements for Illinois Solar for All sub-programs can be found in Chapter 8.     
2.9.3.4.  Small and Emerging Businesses  
P.A. 102-0662 introduced new language into Section 1-56(b)(2) encouraging the Agency to “make 
every effort to ensure that small and emerging businesses, particularly those located in low-income 
and environmental justice communities, are able to participate in the Illinois Solar for All Program.”  
This language provides no definition for what constitutes a “small” or “emerging” business, but does 
list activities that would constitute such efforts: proactive support from the program administrator; 
different or preferred access to subprograms and administrator-identified customers or grassroots 
education provider-identified customers, and different incentive levels.  This Plan’s approach to 
supporting small and emerging businesses under Illinois Solar for All can be found in Chapter 8.   
57

58,66,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
This new language contains a reporting requirement, through which the IPA “shall report on progress 
and barriers to participation of small and emerging businesses in the Illinois Solar for All Program at 
least once a year.”  That report must be made available on the IPA’s website and included with the 
Long-Term Plan in applicable years.   
2.9.4.  Illinois Solar for All—Third-party Program Administrator  
To assist the Agency in its administration of the Illinois Solar for All Program, Section 1-56(b)(5) 
permits the Agency to retain a third-party program administrator (or administrators) through an 
RFQ/RFP solicitation and competitive bid process. The selection criteria and requirements must 
include, but are not limited to, “experience in administering low-income energy programs and 
overseeing statewide clean energy or energy efficiency services.”   
Through revisions to Section 1-56(b)(2)(5), Illinois law now provides that the Illinois Solar for All 
program administrator “may be, but need not be, the same administrator as for the Adjustable Block 
Program.”  Through this Plan the Agency shall also determine “if individual subprograms of the 
Illinois Solar for All Program are better served by a different or separate Program Administrator.”  As 
a public body, however, retention of any such new or different Program Administrators could only 
be accomplished through a process otherwise consistent with state law.    
In addition to the day-to-day administration of the Illinois Solar for All Program (which includes 
review and approval of Approved Vendor and project applications, development and enforcement of 
program requirements, development of program materials and communications, interfacing with 
potential applicants, and related activities), the Program Administrator’s responsibilities now also 
include the following:   
•  Facilitating placement for graduates of Illinois-based renewable energy-specific job training 
programs, including the Clean Jobs Workforce Network Program and the Illinois Climate 
Works Pre-apprenticeship Program administered by the DCEO Department of Commerce and 
programs administered under Section 16-108.12 of the Public Utilities Act;   
•  Developing a web-based clearinghouse for information available to both job training program 
graduates and firms participating, directly or indirectly, in Illinois solar incentive programs;  
•  Coordinating its activities with entities implementing electric and natural gas income-
qualified  energy  efficiency  programs,  including  customer  referrals  to  and  from  such 
programs,  and  connecting  prospective  low-income  solar  customers  with  any  existing 
deferred maintenance programs where applicable.    
In September 2018, after the conclusion of its RFQ and RFP process, the Agency contracted with 
Elevate Energy (“Elevate”) to serve as the third-party program administrator for the Illinois Solar for 
All Program.  
2.9.5.  Illinois Solar for All—Referrals  
New paragraph (8) of Section 1-56(b) requires that, as part of the IPA’s Long-Term Plan development 
and update, the Agency develop plans for three additional sets of referral activities:  
(A) Actions to refer customers from the Illinois Solar for All Program to electric and natural gas 
income-qualified energy efficiency programs, and vice versa, with the goal of increasing 
participation in both programs;  
58 
 ",2. Statutory Requirements of the Plan ,[],664,14,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
59,67,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
(B) Effective procedures for data sharing, as needed, to effectuate referrals between the Illinois 
Solar for All Program and both electric and natural gas income-qualified energy efficiency 
programs, including sharing customer information directly with the utilities, as needed and 
appropriate; and  
(C) Efforts to identify any existing deferred maintenance programs for which prospective Solar 
for All Program customers may be eligible and connect prospective customers for whom 
deferred maintenance is or may be a barrier to solar installation to those programs. 
The Agency’s approach for these activities can be found in Chapter 8.   
2.10.  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Requirements  
Public Act 102-0662 created new requirements and authorities for the IPA designed to ensure 
“priority access to the clean energy economy for businesses and workers from communities that have 
been  excluded  from  economic  opportunities  in  the  energy  sector,  have  been  subject  to 
disproportionate levels of pollution, and have disproportionately experienced negative public health 
outcomes.”  To advance that objective, Section 1-75 now includes five new subparagraphs.  
The first element of the diversity and equity framework, Section 1-75(c-10), directs the Agency to 
develop an equity accountability system, which shall include: minimum equity standards applicable 
to all applicants to the Agency’s renewable energy procurements under Section 1-75(c); the Equity 
Eligible  Contractor  category  within  the  ABP  (see  Chapter  10);  and  “equity  prioritization  for 
noncompetitive procurements” that advance the equity goals of the Act. All applicants for the 
Agency’s renewable energy procurements must meet a new minimum equity standard, defined in the 
law as “at least 10% of the project workforce for each entity” qualifying as equity eligible persons. 
The law requires that this percentage increase to a statewide average of 30% by 2030, with the 
annual increase in that interim determined by the Agency in this plan. The law prohibits participation 
in Agency procurement programs by an approved vendor or designee that failed to meet the 
minimum equity standard in the prior delivery year, and Section 1-75(c-30) provides explicit 
authority for the Agency to deny participation or withhold certification as an approved vendor or 
designee to enforce this standard.  
Section 1-75(c-10) does not define “renewable energy procurements” as used in this section but does 
specify that the 10% minimum equity standard applies to “each entity participating in a procurement 
program outlined in this subsection (c-10).” Other requirements under this subsection, such as an 
annual compliance plan, are only required from “each entity participating in a procurement program 
of  subsection  (c)  of  this  Section,”  and  Section  1-75(c-30)  provides  that  the  penalty  for  non-
compliance with (c-10) shall be to “deny the entity's ability to participate in procurement programs 
in subsection (c).” The Agency therefore interprets this section as only applying to those renewable 
energy procurement programs established through Section 1-75(c) of the Act, not to include the 
Illinois Solar for All Program.  
For  competitive  procurements,  Section  1-75(c-10)(3)  requires  that  the  Agency  “develop 
requirements for ensuring that competitive procurement processes, including utility-scale solar, 
utility-scale wind, and brownfield site photovoltaic projects, advance the equity goals” of the new 
provisions of the Act. Specifically, the Agency shall, through this Long-Term Plan, create “bid 
application requirements and a bid evaluation methodology” to ensure that applicants engage equity 
eligible  contractors  and  to  optimize  the  amount  of  contract  value  flowing  to  equity  eligible 
contractors. Further details on this process may be found in Chapter 5. The law provides that the 
10% minimum equity standard and other equity accountability requirements in Section 1-75(c-10) 
also apply to entities participating in competitive procurements “to the extent practicable.” The 
59 
 ",2. Statutory Requirements of the Plan ,[],835,17,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
60,68,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Agency understands this to mean that bidders in competitive procurements will be required to file 
compliance plans in a similar manner to Approved Vendors. As the concept of designees as used in 
the Adjustable Block Program (to identify entities working with an approved vendor on customer-
facing activities such as sale, marketing, and installation) does not translate to the process of 
developing utility-scale projects, the entity that is the bidder for the project will be responsible for 
the submittal of the compliance plan.    
Section 1-75(c-10)(4) creates several new requirements to be included in each revision to the long-
term renewable resources procurement plan, which can be seen in full detail in Chapter 10, all of 
which provide the infrastructure to facilitate and monitor the success of the equity accountability 
system. These include:  
1.  A mechanism for measuring and reporting project workforce profiles at the approved vendor 
or designee level; 
2.  Training, guidance, and other support for approved vendors, designees, eligible contractors, 
and other stakeholders related to the EEC category within ABP and the percentage minimum 
equity standards;  
3.  An application process for a waiver of the minimum equity standard, which the Agency shall 
grant only in “rare circumstances” where the applicant provides evidence of “significant 
efforts” toward meeting the standard. Waivers are project-specific and only valid for a single 
delivery year.   
 
The second pillar of the equity provisions of P.A. 102-0662 empowers the Agency to proactively 
assess and attempt to ameliorate existing racial discrimination or disparities in access to and rates 
of participation in the clean energy economy. Section 1-75(c-15)(2) directs the Agency to publish a 
report assessing the efficacy of the equity accountability system set out in subsection (c-10) one year 
after that system is implemented. The Agency subsequently must commission and publish a racial 
disparity study to “measure the presence and impact of discrimination on minority businesses and 
workers in Illinois’ clean energy economy” as a whole. This study is to be conducted in collaboration 
with  other  relevant  state  agencies,  including  the  Department  of  Commerce  and  Economic 
Opportunity and the Department of Labor.  
As demonstrated by the required studies in subsection (c-15), P.A. 102-0662 explicitly recognizes 
that “data collection, data analysis, and reporting are critical to ensure that the benefits of the clean 
energy economy … are equitably distributed across the State” in Section 1-75(c-20). The third pillar 
of the new diversity and equity framework directs the Agency to “collect data from program 
applicants  in  order  to  track  and  improve  equitable  distribution  of  benefits  across  Illinois 
communities for all procurements the Agency conducts.” Specifically, the law requires that the 
Agency collect demographic and geographic data, including racial and ethnic identity, from program 
applicants and participants regarding their employees, contractors, and subcontractors. Notably, the 
agency must collect this information from each entity “awarded contracts under any Agency-
administered program,” which is a wider universe of entities than those subject to the minimum 
equity standards, as that is limited to programs in Section 1-75(c). The Agency understands this 
distinction to require that the Agency collect demographic and geographic data from applicants to 
the  ILSFA  Program  as  well.  That  data  shall  be  aggregated  and  published  annually,  ensuring 
transparency and public accountability.  
Finally, Section 1-75(c-25) establishes the fourth pillar of the diversity and equity framework: an 
Energy Workforce Equity Database. This Database, to be created in consultation with the Department 
of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, will facilitate the engagement of equity eligible contractors 
and persons on clean energy projects by serving as an easy to use, publicly available, and “searchable

61,69,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
database of suppliers, vendors, and subcontractors for clean energy industries.” This subsection also 
directs the Agency to “create an easily accessible, public facing online tool using the database 
information,” which the Agency understands to be a separate resource from the Energy Workforce 
Equity Database, as its content is laid out in a separate subparagraph.  
As described in the law, this online tool shall include a broader set of capabilities and information, 
including: 
1.  “a map of environmental justice and equity investment eligible communities;  
2.  job postings and recruiting opportunities;   
3.  a means by which recruiting clean energy companies can find and interact with current or 
former participants of clean energy workforce training programs;  
4.  information on workforce training service providers and training opportunities; 
5.  renewable energy company diversity reporting;  
6.  a list of equity eligible contractors;  
7.  reporting on outcomes of the workforce programs of the Energy Transition Act; and  
8.  information about the Jobs and Environmental Justice Grant Program, the Clean Energy Jobs 
and Justice Fund, and other sources of capital.” 
 
Additional features may also be considered to ensure that this online tool effectively accomplishes 
desired engagement and facilitation, and the Agency plans to take additional feedback on its design.  
The law does not provide a specific timeline for the Energy Workforce Equity Database or the related 
online tool. The Agency will collaborate with DCEO to develop these resources in an expeditious 
manner.  
2.11.  Self-direct Renewable Portfolio Standard Compliance Program 
Also added through P.A. 102-0662 is subparagraph (R) of Section 1-75(c)(1); under this new 
subparagraph,  the  IPA  must  “establish  a  self-direct  renewable  portfolio  standard  compliance 
program for eligible self-direct customers that purchase renewable energy credits from utility-scale 
wind and solar projects through long-term agreements.”  Chapter 6 outlines requirements applicable 
to this new self-direct program, and a brief overview of the program can be found below.   
This new self-direct program has three main components of eligibility for successful participation: 
customer requirements; project requirements applicable to the renewable energy project from 
which that customer retires RECs or has RECs retired on its behalf; and contract requirements 
applicable to the contract through which the customer receives those RECs.    
A qualifying self-direct customer must be a retail customer of an Illinois electric utility with a peak 
demand of at least 10,000 kilowatts.  Thus, this program is intended to provide self-direct RPS 
benefits back to only large customers, although customers with the same corporate parents may 
aggregate account demands to meet this 10,000-kilowatt threshold.   
That customer must have a contract for the delivery of RECs with a renewable energy project.  That 
project must be a “new” utility-scale wind or utility-scale solar project which meets the locational 
requirements of Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) of the Act (or that were otherwise in place at the time of the 
contract’s execution).  If those contracts were entered into after the effective date of Public Act 102-
0662, that project must also meet applicable labor and diversity, equity, and inclusion requirements 
that would otherwise be applicable to new utility-scale wind and utility-scale solar projects.   
61 
 ",2. Statutory Requirements of the Plan ,[],689,18,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
62,70,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Certain requirements also apply to the contract instrument itself—mainly, that it must be a long-term 
contract, which Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(2) defines as “at least 10 years” in length, and that it must “be 
equivalent in volume to at least 40% of the eligible self-direct customer's usage, determined annually 
by the eligible self-direct customer's usage during the previous delivery year, measured to the 
nearest megawatt-hour.”  This volumetric requirement may be met through multiple contracts with 
qualifying new utility-scale wind or solar projects       
The benefit back to a customer successfully participating in the self-direct program is a reduction in 
charges levied (or “credit”) to support the RPS pursuant Section 16-108(k) of the PUA.  That credit is 
calculated as “the anticipated cost of renewable energy credit deliveries under contracts for new 
utility-scale wind and new utility-scale solar entered for each delivery year after the large energy 
customer begins retiring eligible new utility scale renewable energy credits for self-compliance.”  
Notably, that credit back to participating customers cannot include “(i) costs associated with any 
contracts entered into before the delivery year in which the customer files the initial compliance 
report to be eligible for participation in the self-direct program, and (ii) costs associated with 
procuring renewable energy credits through existing and future contracts through the Adjustable 
Block Program, subsection (c-5) of this Section 1-75, and the Solar for All Program.”136  In its Final 
Order approving the Plan in Docket No. 22-0231, the Illinois Commerce Commission determined that 
“a three-year rolling average of eligible utility-scale REC delivery contracts” be used to establish the 
self-direct credit value.137  Thus, Section 1-75(c)(1)(R) lacks a single known, discrete credit level back 
to qualifying self-direct customers (as the cost of utility-scale contracts in future years is not yet 
knowable and will change over time).    
For RPS goals, targets, and budgets, Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(3) provides that each REC procured 
pursuant to the self-direct program “shall reduce the total volume of renewable energy credits the 
Agency is otherwise required to procure from new utility-scale projects on behalf of contracting 
utilities where the eligible self-direct customer is located.”  Additionally, the “reduction in the 
volumetric charges collected pursuant to Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act for approved 
eligible self-direct customers” reduces the available RPS budget—although the amount of that 
reduction is dependent on the level of the credit back to approved customers, and as outlined above, 
those credit amounts will vary over time.    
More information about this new self-direct program, including initial analysis on the potential 
program size, can be found in Chapter 6.  The self-direct RPS compliance program is scheduled to 
begin receiving initial applications in February 2023, with customer participation beginning June 1, 
2023.

3. REC Portfolio, RPS Goals, Targets, and Budgets 
3.1. Background  
Illinois originally established the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard in 2007 through Public Act 
95-0481, which became effective on June 1, 2008. The annual percentage goals set for the RPS were 
relative to the “eligible retail load,” which was defined as residential and small commercial customers 
that received fixed-price bundled service from their utility rather than service from an ARES. 
Beginning with the 2008-2009 delivery year, the procurement of renewable energy resources for 
Illinois RPS compliance started with at least 2% of the “eligible retail load” with a targeted increase 
to 25% by the 2025-2026 delivery year. Surcharges were assessed to those default supply customers 
(and only those customers) to support renewable energy resource procurements intended to meet 
these RPS goals.  
In 2009, Public Act 96-0033 added Section 16-115D to the Public Utilities Act, which created separate 
RPS obligations for ARES. ARES compliance was based on the total metered electricity delivered by 
the ARES to retail customers in Illinois, but with very different compliance mechanisms as explained 
in Section 2.1.3 above – namely, the payment of Alternative Compliance Payments and the self-
procurement/retirement of RECs from a broad geographic footprint.   
In 2017, Public Act 99-0906 significantly revised the RPS goals by phasing out the ARES compliance 
obligations over a two-year period ending on May 31, 2019 and established goals for the entire retail 
customer load in Illinois (see Appendix B, Section 2.2.2.3 for more information). Just as goals now 
applied to all retail customer load, so did the applicable funding mechanism – non-bypassable 
charges began being levied to all retail customers, regardless of supply source, to support RPS 
activities intended to meet RPS goals now applicable to all retail customer load. Likewise, these 
revisions also consolidated the RPS into a single, centralized planning mechanism for procurements 
and programs as described in this Plan.  
In 2021, with the enactment of Public Act 102-0662 on September 15, 2021, the Illinois RPS was 
further revised and expanded through changes including new RPS goals increasing by 3% each year 
after the 2025-2026 delivery year (by which “25% by 2025” would be reached) to reach 40% by the 
2030-2031 delivery year and a further goal to reach 50% by the 2040-2041 delivery year. These 
percentages reflect the amount of RECs required to be procured for a given delivery year as a 
percentage of delivery year load: thus, if statewide retail customer load in 2040 is 120 million MWh, 
then under a 50% RPS goal, 60 million RECs would need to be procured for annual delivery to meet 
this goal. P.A. 102-0662 also enacted substantial changes to specific quantitative targets for new wind 
and solar – 45 million RECs delivered annually by 2030 from new wind and solar projects – and a 
significant expansion of RPS budgets, including additional flexibility around rolling over prior years’ 
collections to meet future years’ expenses.  
As the utilities serve as the counterparty Buyers to RECs under REC delivery contracts (with those 
REC purchases then funded through non-bypassable charges to those utilities’ ratepayers), this 
compliance is also assessed at the utility level. The resulting analysis includes a determination of 
what quantity of RECs presently is, and ultimately needs to be, under contract to meet the applicable

outline RPS progress by RECs under contract for Commonwealth Edison Company, Ameren Illinois, 
and MidAmerican Energy Company.  
As used in this brief explanation and throughout this Plan, the Agency considers a “goal” to be an 
overall percentage of load to be procured in the form of RECs for a given year based upon that year’s 
mandated  RPS  requirement.138  By  contrast,  a  “target”  is  the  number  of  RECs  for  a  specific 
procurement event or program based upon a specific goal or numerical mandate. 
The Tables and Figures contained in this chapter will be updated by the Agency on a quarterly basis  
and will be published on the Agency’s website. As this Plan was finalized in August 2022 and reflects 
updated inputs where available, the Agency expects the first standalone update to be published by 
November 2022.  
3.2. REC Portfolio 
For the planning and development of the various procurements and programs under this 2022 Long-
Term Plan, the Agency has aggregated the utility level portfolios of all existing RECs under contract, 
which includes all expected RECs under the Adjustable Block Program and all expected RECs under 
contract through competitive procurements, into a single, statewide portfolio of RECs. The statewide 
portfolio can then be examined against REC goals and targets mandated in the Act to estimate gaps 
that need to be filled through future procurement of RECs.  
The following sections examine existing REC portfolios and the resulting statewide REC Portfolio 
after accounting for expected deliveries of RECs resulting from REC delivery contracts executed to 
date.139  
3.2.1.  Existing REC Portfolios – RECs Already Under Contract 
Figure 3-1 and Table 3-1 show the aggregated statewide portfolio and the existing REC portfolio of 
each utility as of August 23, 2022. This includes RECs from the following categories:  
•  RECs procured under the Long-Term Power Purchase Agreements (LTPPAs”) entered into in 
2010 (20 year contracts);  
•  RECs procured under the Distributed Generation procurement events conducted by the IPA 
in 2015, 2016, and 2017 (5-year contracts that, in some cases, expire during the period 
outlined below);  
•  RECs procured under the initial forward procurements the procurement events conducted to 
date by the IPA pursuant to the Initial Plan, and the Spring 2022 Indexed REC procurement;  
•  RECs procured and under contracts resulting from the Adjustable Block Program and the 
Illinois Solar for All Program, which includes the RECs associated with the reopening of the 
Adjustable Block Program in December 2021.  
As discussed further below, the Total RECs under contract has declined slightly relative to the IPA’s 
April 20, 2020 Final First Revised Plan, as this figure now accounts for project attrition (i.e., projects 
under REC delivery contracts not planning to be developed, or otherwise not planning to perform 
under REC delivery contracts) from projects receiving REC delivery contracts under the IPA’s 
Forward Procurement events.  
 
138 For example, the RPS “goal” for the 2022-2023 delivery year is 19% of the retail load. 
139 Appendix B-1 contains breakdowns of RPS goals and budget by each utility.

The utilities’ existing REC portfolios can be assembled to produce the Statewide REC Portfolio 
presented in Figure 3-1. This Figure provides an overview of the volume of RECs presently expected 
to be delivered to meet the various RPS goals and targets mandated in the Act. Table 3-1 provides a

These totals do not account for the additional procurements or program capacity proposed in this 
and future Long-Term Plans. Consequently, these totals do not constitute the IPA’s projections of 
progress toward meeting RPS goals in upcoming delivery years; they merely reflect the Statewide 
REC Portfolio given REC delivery contracts presently in place as of the finalization of this 2022 Long-
Term Plan and serve as a snapshot of the current status of the RPS portfolio. Table 3-5 and Figure 3-2 
below which describe the gap in RECs remaining to be procured, include estimates of how the REC 
portfolio will grow with additional RECs associated with the actual volumes from the Adjustable 
Block Program reopening, and the results of the May 2022 procurement for RECs from utility-scale 
wind, solar, and brownfield site photovoltaic projects. 
As available annual RPS budgets have increased significantly through P.A. 102-0662’s changes to 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(E) of the IPA Act (increasing the statutory rate impact cap) and Section 16-108(k) 
of the PUA (allowing for prior years’ collections to be rolled over to meet future years’ expenses over 
a 5-year period on a “first in, first out” basis), additional funds are now available to support  
procurement activity toward meeting RPS targets and goals. The IPA is thus proposing additional 
program activity and procurement events that would serve to significantly increase the balance of 
RECs under contract in future delivery years. Section 3.4.6 below provides an overview of how the 
REC portfolio (and associated budget impacts) would change as a result of these proposed activities.   
3.3. RPS Goals and Targets 
Developing the 2022 Long-Term Plan first involves calculation of the annual REC targets and goals 
required by statute, and next determining the quantities of RECs to be procured to fill identified gaps 
between RECs under contract and RECs needed to be procured. In the prior Section, a statewide 
current REC portfolio was presented. The REC quantities in that portfolio will be used in conjunction 
with the REC targets and goals outlined in this Section to estimate REC “gaps” that need to be filled 
to meet statutory RPS goals and targets. 
The volume of RECs that need to be procured through the Agency’s procurements and programs can 
be viewed in two ways. First, as the “Target REC Gap” which is the quantity needed to meet the 
specific quantitative targets found in Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) of the Act (e.g., 45 million RECs from new 
wind and solar by 2030); and second, as the “Goal REC Gap” which is quantity needed to meet the 
annual percentage based goals found in Section 1-75(c)(1)(B) of the Act (which could include RECs 
that are not from “new” wind or solar, such as RECs delivered under the LTPPAs). As described below, 
the Target REC Gap has only two milestone check-ins under statute: a 2020-2021 delivery year target 
(10 million RECs delivered annually) and a 2030-2031 delivery year target (45 million RECs 
delivered annually). In contrast, as Section 1-75(c)(1)(B) assigns specific percentage increases off of 
a baseline to each individual delivery year, the Goal REC Gap can be calculated on an annual basis.  
3.3.1.  RPS Goals 
RPS annual goals are expressed as percentages in Section 1-75(c)(1)(B) of the Act. To determine the 
number of RECs required to meet the goals (the “Overall RPS Target”), the delivery year RPS goal is 
applied to the reference year applicable retail customer load (“Applicable Load”) as shown in 
equation (1).  
(1)  Delivery  Year  Overall  RPS  Target  =  Delivery  Year  RPS  Goal  *  Reference  Year 
Applicable Load

budgets  for  delivery  years  2021-2022  through  2026-2027.  Additional  details are  available in 
Appendix B.140  
Through changes to the RPS made via P.A. 99-0906, the annual RPS percentage goal is applied to the 
total retail electricity load rather than the “eligible retail load.” These goals were further extended by 
P.A. 102-0662 to increase by 3% after the 2025-2026 delivery year.

electricity sales)

2030-2031  40.0% 
 
As a result of the funding challenges that constrained RPS activities in previous years, meeting the 
current RPS goals of the IPA Act would require procuring approximately 17 million additional RECs 
for the 2022-2023 delivery year and increasing to the forecasted procurement of an additional 40 
million RECs for the 2031-2032 delivery year. Achieving these goals would require a substantial 
increase in new renewable energy generation under contract, likely requiring well over 10,000 MW 
of new renewable energy generation.  
This 2022 Long-Term Plan presents the start of a ramping up of procurement and program activities 
towards meeting these annual percentage goals. However, given the present gaps, it will take several 
years of procurements to be on that procurement trajectory, with additional time required for project 
development and construction for these REC delivery goals to be achieved. 
3.3.2.  RPS Targets 
As amended by P.A. 102-0662, Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) of the Act now requires the procurement of 
RECs “from new projects” in an amount equal to at least “10,000,000 renewable energy credits 
delivered annually by the end of the 2021 delivery year, and increasing ratably to reach 45,000,000 
renewable energy credits delivered annually from new wind and solar projects by the end of delivery 
year  2030”  such  that  the  percentage-based  RPS  goals  outlined  above  “are  met  entirely  by 
procurements of renewable energy credits from new wind and photovoltaic projects.”141  
Of the target amount 45% is required to be procured from wind projects and 55% from photovoltaic 
projects. Of the amount to be procured from photovoltaic projects, 50% is to be procured through

corresponding minor impact on estimated annual RPS goals and budget collections. The impact of 
variations in load forecasts is discussed further in Section 3.4.8. 
The retail customer load serves as the denominator in calculating RPS Goals. In other words, if retail 
load were 100,000,000 MWH in a year where the goal was 25%, then the REC Goal would be 25% of 
100,000,000 or 25,000,000 RECs delivered annually. If 10,000,000 RECs had been procured for that 
year, then the resulting Goal REC Gap would be 15,000,000 RECs.  
Over time, the Large Customer Self-Direct Program described in Chapter 6 will also serve to reduce 
that denominator, as Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(2)(vii) states that “[e]ach renewable energy credit 
procured pursuant to this subparagraph (R) by a self-direct customer shall reduce the total volume 
of renewable energy credits the Agency is otherwise required to procure from new utility-scale 
projects pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) on behalf of contracting 
utilities where the eligible self-direct customer is located.” While this portion of the Self-Direct 
Program statute addresses only Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)’s targets, because Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)’s 
quantitative  targets  are  a  subset  of  Section  1-75(c)(1)(B)’s  percentage-based  goals,  the  IPA 
understands  that  any  reduction  in  targets  and  load  resultant  from  self-direct  customer  REC 
retirements would also necessitate an adjustment percentage-based REC Goal progress. As those 
Self-Direct  Program-related  adjustments  have  not  yet  been  established  or  determined,  no 
adjustments have been made for this 2022 Long-Term Plan. The Agency will update applicable 
figures in tables in the future as that information becomes available. 
3.3.4.  Overall REC Procurement Targets and Goals – REC Gap 
The overall number of RECs needed to be procured for each year to meet annual Goal REC Gap is the 
difference between the RPS Target RECs from Table 3-5 and the total number of current RECs in the 
Statewide REC Portfolio as shown in Figure 3-1. RECs currently under contract come from several 
sources. First, RECs from Long-Term Power Purchase Agreements (“LTPPAs”) for utility-scale wind 
and solar from a procurement conducted in 2010; second, RECs from utility-scale wind, solar, and 
brownfield site photovoltaics from forward procurements conducted in 2018 through 2019 and the 
first Indexed REC procurement conducted in Spring 2022; and third, IPA Programs which include 
RECs from the Adjustable Block Program and RECs from the Illinois Solar for All Program. For 
additional  information  on  the  LTPPAs  and  forward  procurements,  please  see  Chapter  5.  For 
additional information on the Adjustable Block Program and Illinois Solar for All, please see Chapters 
7 and 8, respectively. Please note that the table below reflects the timing of expected deliveries from 
existing contracts resultant from procurement activity already conducted, and not procurement 
event dates; REC deliveries may lag REC delivery contract execution by 1-5 years depending on 
project size and complexity.

3.3.5.  Procurement Targets to Meet Specific Wind-Solar Requirement and 
Overall RPS Targets 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)(i) of the Act requires that, to the extent possible, the overall quantity of RECs 
procured to meet the RPS goals should include at least 45% from new wind projects and 55% from 
new photovoltaic projects. Of the portion that is from photovoltaic projects, 50% should be from the 
Adjustable  Block  Program,  47%  from  new  utility-scale  solar,  and  3%  from  brownfield  site 
photovoltaic projects.146 Table 3-7 below shows that the portfolio of expected REC deliveries 
portioned by RECs from wind and photovoltaic projects. This table represents RECs under contract 
from procurements and programs conducted as of the finalization of this 2022 Long-Term Plan.

This table indicates that the balance of RECs currently in the portfolio is slightly out of balance with 
the goals of the Act. Additionally, because Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)(iii) provides that “no renewable 
energy credits from contracts entered into before June 1, 2021 shall be used to calculate whether the 
Agency has procured the correct proportion of new wind and new solar contracts,” the balance of 
wind RECs versus solar RECs is best assessed on a forward-looking basis.   
This Chapter’s quantities of RECs under contract from utility-scale procurements held in 2017 and 
2018 have been updated from the Initial and Revised Long-Term Plans to account for project attrition 
(i.e., projects receiving REC delivery contracts not being successfully developed under the terms of 
those contracts). While four wind projects and six utility-scale solar projects have begun delivery, 
other  projects  have  not  yet  been  energized.  Five  solar  projects  have  requested  energization 
extensions that will take them into 2022-2023 delivery year, and four solar projects and two wind 
projects have been removed from the REC portfolio due to project attrition.  
Table 3-8 summarizes in aggregate the status of anticipated annual REC deliveries from utility-scale 
projects, setting aside that projects may begin initial deliveries in different delivery years. The 
quantities listed are the aggregate annual contracted amounts.

and solar, RECs from the 2015-2019 Utility DG procurements, RECs from the 2017-2019 Forward Procurements, and RECs currently under 
contract from the Adjustable Block Program and the Illinois Solar for All Program.

149 “Removed” indicates RECs that were procured in the 2017 and 2018 procurements but will not be delivered because of the projects not 
meeting energization deadlines and thus have been removed from the RPS REC Portfolio.

In comparison to these utility-scale project attrition rates, the attrition rate for the Adjustable Block 
Program has been lower, at approximately 1.2% of contracted Small DG projects, 9.8% of contracted 
Large DG projects, and 7.2% of contracted community solar projects. However, the sample size for 
utility-scale solar projects is small and causes for attrition may be project specific, and thus may not 
necessarily indicative of attrition rates for projects in future procurements. Additionally, the Agency 
is hopeful that the shift to an Indexed REC pricing model as required under Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(v) 
of the Act will reduce the development risk to new utility-scale projects, as those changes should help 
ensure revenue certainty for projects receiving REC delivery contracts.   
3.4. RPS Budget 
3.4.1.  Statewide Goals and Allocation of Cost and RECs from RPS 
Procurements to Each Utility 
The specific numerical targets included in the Act—for instance, the 10,000,000 RECs from new wind 
and new photovoltaics by the 2021 delivery year—are statewide targets which do not specify 
individualized REC targets for each utility. Since the passage of P.A. 99-0906, the Agency has procured 
RECs through its competitive procurements based on statewide RPS targets rather than individual 
targets by utility, such that an overall target quantity is published and projects are selected up to that 
overall target quantity. Contract quantities stemming from those procurements were then assigned 
to each of the three participating utilities based on an RPS Budget-weighted basis, meaning that an 
individual utility-scale solar or wind project may have three REC delivery contracts (one with each 
of Ameren Illinois, ComEd, and MidAmerican) for load-weighted delivery quantities.   
In a corresponding manner, the cost of purchasing RECs associated with RPS procurements is 
allocated to each utility through REC procurement contracts specific to the applicable utility (and 
independent  of  supplier  performance  under  other  utilities’  contracts),  based on  each  utility’s 
Renewable Portfolio Standard Budget (“RPS Budget”) – which is also based on load.  
Table 3-9 shows the proposed allocation across each of the three utilities based on each utility’s cost 
cap rate and eligible load.150  
   
 
150 This allocation method was initially developed to allocate the RECs from the August 31, 2017 Initial Forward Procurement and was 
based on the RPS Budget for 2020-2021, which uses the prior year delivered volumes as reference. The 2019-2020 reference delivery year 
was used because it will be the first year when all load, including that served by ARES, will be under the IPA’s REC procurements, thus 
making the resulting RPS Budget a better representation of future RPS Budgets. As shown in Table 3-9 the allocation to each utility is based 
on the utility’s share of the 2022-2023 delivery year RPS Budget. As noted in Chapter 6, the same allocation will generally be used for the 
Adjustable Block Program contract awards.

Under this allocation, for every $1,000,000 of expenditures made to procure RECs, $273,190 and 
associated REC contracts would be allocated to Ameren Illinois, $724,450 and associated REC 
contracts to ComEd, and $2,370 and associated REC contracts to MidAmerican.  
For this 2022 Long-Term Plan, the Agency proposes to continue conducting the procurement of RECs 
based on statewide RPS goals and targets which, due to changes in load forecasts and the presence 
of new RECs under contract, have been updated from those contained in prior Plans. These values 
will also be updated in future iterations of the Plan to reflect the implementation of the Large 
Customer Self-Direct Program described in Chapter 6.  
3.4.2.  Cost Cap and Cost Recovery Provisions 
The IPA’s procurement of RECs on behalf of Illinois electric utilities is subject to monetary limitations 
in the form of a cost cap that limits the annual average net increase to all eligible retail customers to 
4.25% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by eligible retail customers during the year ending May 
31, 2009.155 The cost cap rate, in dollars per megawatt-hour, is provided in Table 3-2. This rate was 
increased by Public Act 102-0662 from the 2.015% of 2007 eligible retail rates statutorily authorized 
in the past. The combination of the different baseline year and increased percentage results in 
significant increases in funding collected each year, ranging from a 211% increase for MidAmerican, 
to a 253% for Ameren, and 266% for ComEd. 
Each utility is entitled to recover the costs of the RECs procured to meet the RPS compliance 
requirements, subject to the cost cap limitations, along with “the reasonable costs that the utility 
incurs as part of the procurement process and to implement and comply with plans and processes 
approved by the Commission.”156  
In addition to changing the cost cap, Public Act 102-0662 made two significant changes to how funds 
collected by the utilities are accounted for. First, the previous reconciliation provision from Public 
 
151 The 2021-2022 delivery year is the reference year for the 2022-2023 delivery year. 
152 The Cost Cap Rate for each utility is defined in Section 1-75(c)(1)(E) of the Act as 4.25% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by eligible 
retail customers during the year ending May 31, 2009, which results in a cost cap rate of 0.45755 c/kWh for Ameren, 0.50248 c/kWh for 
ComEd, and 0.26250 c/kWh for MidAmerican. 
153 Beginning with the 2019-2020 delivery year, the RPS Budget for each utility is calculated by multiplying the values of the preceding two 
columns of the table, as specified by Section 1-75(c)(1)(F) of the Act (“To arrive at a maximum dollar amount of renewable energy 
resources to be procured for the particular delivery year, the resulting per kilowatthour amount shall be applied to the actual amount of 
kilowatthours of electricity delivered […] by the electric utility in the delivery year immediately prior to the procurement to all retail 
customers in its service territory.”). 
154 The methodology to determine MidAmerican’s Applicable load is explained in Section 3.7.

Act 99-0906 that required a reconciliation of collections and expenses (e.g., a refund to customers of 
unspent funds) after four years (June 1, 2021), and then on an annual basis thereafter, was replaced 
with new language in Section 16-108(k) of the PUA that allows for collections from customers to be 
available for meeting RPS expenses for the five years following collection:  
Money collected from customers for the procurement of renewable energy resources in 
a given delivery year may be spent by the utility for the procurement of renewable 
resources over any of the following 5 delivery years after which unspent money shall be 
credited back to retail customers. The electric utility shall spend all money collected in 
earlier delivery years that has not yet been returned to customers, first, before spending 
money collected in later delivery years. 
Second,  that  Section  16-1085(k)  of  the  PUA  was  also  modified  to  provide  that  any  future 
reconciliation amounts shall be reduced to account for contractual obligations entered into by the 
utilities but not yet paid:  
The amount of excess funds eligible to be credited back to retail customers shall be 
reduced by an amount equal to the payment obligations required by any contracts 
entered into by an electric utility under contracts described in subsection (b) of Section 
1-56 and subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, even if such 
payments have not yet been made and regardless of the delivery year in which those 
payment  obligations  were  incurred.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary, 
including in tariffs authorized by this subsection (k) in effect before the effective date of 
this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, all unspent funds as of May 31, 
2021, excluding any funds credited to customers during any utility billing cycle that 
commences prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General 
Assembly, shall remain in the utility account and shall on a first in, first out basis be used 
toward utility payment obligations under contracts described in subsection (b) of 
Section 1-56 and subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. 
Prior to the enactment of Public Act 102-0662, Section 16-018(k) of the PUA required annual 
reconciliation of collections and expenditures after June 1, 2021. This proved unduly constraining, as 
expenses rolled forward into future years (especially due to project energization delays) while 
collections could not be rolled forward to meet those expenses. This phenomenon limited available 
budgets prevent the Agency from opening additional blocks of the Adjustable Block Program or 
conducting additional utility-scale procurements. The COVID-19 global health pandemic further 
exacerbated this problem, as many expenditures that had been projected to occur prior to June 1, 
2021 were pushed out well beyond that date due to resultant project development delays, resulting 
in the potential for a significant refund of unexpended—but contractually committed—RPS funds.   
This left the Agency with an available RPS budget too small to meet contracted RPS expenses. As a 
result, the IPA petitioned the ICC to reopen Docket No. 19-0995 approving the Agency’s First Revised 
Plan to clarify the process by which payment deferrals on REC delivery contracts would occur.  While 
the Commission approved that process in May of 2021, the enactment of Public Act 102-0662 
rendered this payment reduction/deferral issue moot through significantly increasing RPS funding 
in addition to the two new accounting provisions outlined above. 
Utilities are able to recover all of their costs—whether associated with RECs previously procured 
through prior-executed contracts, procured through the Initial Forward Procurements, procured

through other competitive procurements, or procured through the other programs resulting from 
the implementation of the IPA’s long-term renewable resource procurement plans157—through 
tariffs applicable to all of the utilities’ customers. With the enactment of Public Act 102-0662, ComEd 
and Ameren filed revised tariffs to implement these revised rate collection levels and those tariffs 
took effect in January of 2022. Tariff revisions by MidAmerican are pending.  
3.4.3.  RPS Compliance Procurement Priorities 
The Act provides guidelines for prioritizing REC procurements in the event that the cost cap 
limitations conflict with the RPS goals and targets such that the IPA cannot procure sufficient 
additional quantities of RECs to meet goals or targets.158 Under Section 1-75(c)(1)(F) of the IPA Act, 
these priorities regarding the procurement of RECs take the following order, arranged based on 
descending priority: 
•  RECs procured under existing contracts (as of June 1, 2021); 
•  RECs procured with funding for the Illinois Solar for All Program; 
•  RECs  procured  to  comply  with  the  new  wind  and  solar  photovoltaic  procurement 
requirements (including the Adjustable Block Program);  
•  RECs procured to meet the remaining RPS targets (Goal REC Gap).  
In contrast to the situation where the cost cap conflicts with RPS Goals and Targets, Section 1-
75(c)(1)(C)(ii) directs that even if goals and targets are met, funds shall continue to be spent:  
In any given delivery year, if forecasted expenses are less than the maximum budget 
available under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (1) the Agency shall continue to 
procure new renewable energy credits until that budget is exhausted in the manner 
outlined in item (i) of this subparagraph (C). 
Subparagraph (E) sets the budget for each year based on a calculation of each utility’s prior year 
MWH volume of sales and the 4.25% rate cap (as discussed in Section 3.4.2). The available funds are 
also impacted by additional considerations in including the ability of funds to be available for five 
years after collection and the reserve of utility-held alternative compliance payments (ACPs”) (see 
Sections 3.4.2 and 3.5). Item (i) of subparagraph (C) establishes targets of 10 million RECs for 2021 
and 45 million RECs for 2030 respectively, as well as the split between solar and wind as described 
in Section 3.3.5. Thus, the Agency understands that Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)(ii) directs the Agency to 
maximize procurement volumes where possible.  
However, REC contracts carry uncertainty about when payments will commence because of the 
varying development times of renewable energy projects as well as payment schedules that span 
multiple years. As a result, the Agency must analyze not only what funds are available in a given 
delivery year, but also what budget may need to be reserved for future delivery years. As a simplified 
example, if forecasted expenses for a year are $10 million less than the budget available for the year, 
but due to prior conducted procurements and programs the projected budget for the following year 
compared to expenses relies on that $10 million being rolled over into that next delivery year to fully 
cover projected expenses, it would not make sense to conduct additional procurement activities in 
the current delivery year to create $10 million in new commitments, as those funds would be needed 
 
157 This is true for those expenses for which the utility is the counterparty; for the Illinois Solar for All Program, the State of Illinois is the 
counterparty to REC delivery contracts paid using the Renewable Energy Resources Fund.

for that future delivery year. Analyzing RPS budget availability requires being cognizant of the 
cascading impacts of commitments on future delivery years. 
As shown in Table 3-11 and Table 3-12, the Agency has considered the budget impacts of: 
•  Procurements and programs to date (REC quantities and payment obligations under existing 
contracts); 
•  Funding allocations to the Illinois Solar for All Program; 
•  The Spring 2022 procurements for utility-scale wind, solar, and brownfield site photovoltaic 
projects, and capacity filled from the December 2021 reopening of the Adjustable Block 
Program; 
•  Procurements and Adjustable Block Program blocks and REC prices proposed in this Plan; 
and 
•  Estimates of activities in subsequent delivery years that would be proposed in subsequent 
Long-Term Plans to meet the 45 million RECs by 2030 target.  
Taking these budget impacts into account, through at least the middle part of the decade the Agency 
projects that the available funding left in each year will be approximately equivalent to one year of 
collections. However, that amount declines over time. This modeling also suggests that the oldest 
funds available for use would never be more than two years old, and thus funds are highly unlikely 
to be subject to reconciliation due to not having been used across the five years following collection.  
The Agency notes that at present, budget impacts resultant from the change to an indexed REC price 
procurement model for competitive procurements are unpredictable.  The Adjustable Block Program 
REC prices used for this budget analysis are for the 2022 Delivery Year, and for the 2023 Delivery 
Year the Agency has made adjustments to reflect the change in the federal Investment Tax Credit 
from the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act (Public Law 117-169), and then an annual 4% 
decline. REC prices for future years are likely to vary from these values as the Agency updates its 
approach for administratively determined REC prices through a stakeholder process for the 2023 
Delivery Year and then through the next Long-Term Plan development process for years thereafter. 
Thus, a very large error band must be applied to any budget forecasts given this inherent uncertainty. 
For this Plan, the Agency has proposed quantities for competitive procurements and Adjustable Block 
Program block sizes that will put it on a path to having procured 45 million RECs delivered annually 
from new projects by the 2030 delivery year.  
As the Agency gains more information about future RPS budget impacts over the next 18 months of 
program  and  procurement  activities,  the  next  Long-Term  Plan  will  consider  whether  those 
procurement quantities could be increased.  
3.4.4.  RPS Budget and Cost Cap 
As described in Section 3.4.2, the Act imposes monetary limitations on the RPS in the form of a cost 
cap that limits the annual average net increase in rates to retail customers. The cost cap rate, in cents 
per kilowatt-hour, is unique to each utility and is provided in Table 3-9. The cents per kilowatt-hour 
rate is applied to the actual electricity (expressed in kilowatt-hours) delivered in the delivery year 
immediately prior to determine a maximum dollar amount which constitutes the RPS Budget for the 
delivery year. Specifically, the Act states that:

Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection (c), the total of renewable energy 
resources procured under the procurement plan for any single year shall be subject to 
the limitations of this subparagraph (E). Such procurement shall be reduced for all retail 
customers based on the amount necessary to limit the annual estimated average net 
increase due to the costs of these resources included in the amounts paid by eligible 
retail customers in connection with electric service to no more than 4.25% of the amount 
paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the year ending May 31, 2009. To arrive 
at a maximum dollar amount of renewable energy resources to be procured for the 
particular delivery year, the resulting per kilowatthour amount shall be applied to the 
actual amount of kilowatthours of electricity delivered, or applicable portion of such 
amount as specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection (c), as applicable, by the electric 
utility in the delivery year immediately prior to the procurement to all retail customers 
in its service territory. The calculations required by this subparagraph shall be made 
only once for each delivery year at the time that the renewable energy resources are 
procured. Once the determination as to the amount of renewable energy resources to 
procure is made based on the calculations set forth in this subparagraph (E) and the 
contracts  procuring  those  amounts  are  executed,  no  subsequent  rate  impact 
determinations shall be made and no adjustments to those contract amounts shall be 
allowed. All costs incurred under such contracts shall be fully recoverable by the electric 
utility as provided in this Section.159 
A utility’s annual RPS Budget is calculated as shown in equation (2).

($/MWh)  
A  utility’s  delivery  year  remaining  available  net  RPS  Budget  (“Available  Net  RPS  Budget”)  is 
determined by subtracting from the utility’s total RPS Budget the direct financial obligations 
associated with existing REC contracts (“Contracted REC Spend”), the balance  associated with 
unfilled Adjustable Block Program block capacity, (“Scheduled REC Spend”), and indirect costs: (i) 
allocation to fund the Illinois Solar for All Program, (ii) allocation to fund job training programs, and 
(iii) set aside for administrative expenses (“Set Asides Allocation”), as shown in equation (3).

For the purpose of establishing funds available for REC purchases, as explained in the following

given year and not spent after five years are subject to reconciliation. However, any reconciliation amount that could be refunded to 
ratepayers is also reduced by an amount equal to the outstanding contracted payment obligations of the utility.

3.4.5.  Other Expenses 
In addition to direct expenditures on RECs, RPS budgets also feature allocations for several additional 
purposes. First, pursuant to Section 1-75(c)(1)(O) of the Act, up to $50,000,000 each year will be 
allocated to the Illinois Solar for All Program.161 Second, also pursuant to Section 1-75(c)(1)(O), in 
each of the delivery years 2021-2022, 2024-2025, and 2027-2028, $10,000,000 of ComEd’s RPS 
Budget will be allocated to the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to fund solar job 
training programs pursuant to Section 16-108.12 of the PUA.  
Third, a reasonable amount of each budget will be set aside for administrative expenses (including, 
but  not  limited  to,  expenses  related  to  development  of  Plan  updates,  the  management  of 
procurements and programs, Adjustable Block Program Administrator expenses not covered by fees 
charged to participants, and fees charged by tracking systems for the retirement of RECs). The IPA 
proposes to set aside 2% of the budget for these administrative expenses, and will refine this amount 
as more information becomes available.  Table 3-10 shows the annual RPS funds to be allocated to 
each of these Set Asides.

3.4.6.  Expenses and Available RPS Budgets 
The aggregation of Expenses and RPS Budgets at a statewide level provides an important tool for 
planning and implementing the various procurements and programs under this 2022 Long-Term 
Plan. 
Table 3-11 presents a statewide view of expected expenses. This includes: 
 
•  Legacy expenses from the 2010 Long-Term Power Purchase Agreements; 
•  Legacy expenses from the Forward Procurements conducted in 2017-2019; 
•  Legacy expenses from the Adjustable Block Program from 2019-2021; 
•  Projected expenses from the capacity filled from the Adjustable Block Program Blocks that 
opened in December 2022,162 as well as the 2022-2023 and 2023-2034 Program Year Blocks 
 
161 Prior to the enactment of Public Act 102-0662 the annual allocation to the Illinois Solar for All Program was the greater of 5% or $10 
million of the utility RPS budget. This increase is discussed in more detail in Section 8.4.3. 
162 This includes capacity associated with Traditional Community Solar Projects selected from the lottery waitlists pursuant to Section 1-
75(c)(1)(G)(iv)(3) of the IPA Act.

described in Chapter 7 (including the rolling over of unfilled capacity from the December 
2021 blocks); 
•  Projected  expenses  for  RECs  from  Utility-scale  Wind,  Utility-Solar,  and  Brownfield 
Photovoltaic Projects conducted in Spring 2022 Subsequent Forward Procurement and the 
procurements proposed in Chapter 5; 
•  Projected expenses for future blocks of the Adjustable Block Program and competitive 
procurements to be conducted in 2024 through 2030 to meet the 45 million new RECs target 
(although the size of those future blocks and procurements will be determined in future Long-
Term Plans); and 
•  Set asides as described in Section 3.4.5. 
 
The projected expenses from the Adjustable Block Program assume that blocks fill every year and 
that projects are energized (and thus start receiving payments) by their respective energization 
deadlines. Projected ABP expenses are calculated using REC prices applicable to the December 14, 
2021 reopening163 and the REC prices presented in Chapter 7 for the 2022 Delivery Year. Due to the 
recent enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act, which increases the Investment Tax Credit from 22% 
to 30%, the Agency has made a 12% downward adjustment for the modeled 2023 Delivery Year REC 
prices to reflect that change, and then assumes a 4% decline in prices each subsequent year).164 As 
discussed in Section 7.3.2, block sizes for the Adjustable Block Program are based on a standard 
capacity factor for different program categories rather than category specific capacity factors to 
translate REC quantities into MW sizes. For the purpose of the budget model presented here, REC 
quantities and their associated expenses use category-specific capacity factors.. 
 
Utility-scale projects are assumed to begin REC deliveries three years after the procurement date. 
For budget modeling, the assumed REC price for utility-scale projects is the average REC price from 
the Agency’s last procurement for each resource type (prior to the most recent Indexed REC 
procurement event). With the implementation of a new indexed REC price procurement approach, it 
is very likely that the REC prices resulting from these procurements may vary from those assumed 
prices used in budget modeling, and furthermore, those costs will change year to year based on 
changes in wholesale energy prices. As the Agency prefers not to suggest indicative prices for future 
procurements, these prices will serve as a proxy until more detailed pricing information is available 
after the completion of additional future procurement events.165    
 
163 See: https://illinoisabp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Illinois-ABP-12.14.21-Reopening-REC-Prices.pdf. 
164 This adjustment is a simplified assumption for this modeling purpose only. The Inflation Reduction Act contains a number of provisions 
that can allow the Investment Tax Credit to be at a higher or lower level. Actual REC prices for the 2023 Delivery Year will be determined 
through a modeling update and stakeholder feedback process as discussed in Section 7.5.7. 
165 Consistent with the Commission’s Order in Docket No. 22-0231, the IPA will be utilizing a forward price curve for estimating budget 
impacts resultant from Indexed REC procurements in future Long-Term Plans.  See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 
at 6.

For each delivery year, Table 3-12 calculates expected RPS collections based on the load data listed 
in Table 3-4 and the RPS collection rates listed in Table 3-9 and the expenses from Table 3-11 and 
calculates, for each year, an expected beginning and ending balance. The 2020-2021 delivery year 
starting balance includes utility-held ACP as well as funds collected but not spent in delivery years 
2017-2018 through 2019-2020. Table 3-9 and Table 3-12 do not include adjustments to RPS 
collections that would result from the implementation of the Large Customer Self-Direct Program 
described in Chapter 6 as the size of that program and applicable rate collection adjustments are 
unknown at this time. Additionally, Large Customer Self-Direct Program participation may reduce 
overall procurement volumes in future years, thus necessitating reduced expenses along with 
reduced collections.

balances never exceed two years of funding collections which indicates that funds spent in any given 
delivery year are funds collected that year or the previous year. However, future budget impacts 
carry significant uncertainty flowing from unknowns including the impact of changes in REC Prices 
adopted in this or future Long-Term Plans, actual REC prices paid from indexed REC contracts, 
changes in utility loads (and thus RPS collections), and the impact of the Large Customer Self-Direct 
Program. Extending the assumptions used herein into the 2030s suggests a potential RPS budget 
shortfall starting in 2035, however those assumptions are highly dependent on future Adjustable 
Block Program REC prices which constitute the bulk of expenditures.167  
As previously committed to through the First Revised Plan, the Agency will seek to have under 
contract projects with likely annual expenditures equaling no more than 95% of expected available 
funds for any given delivery year to guard against the potential payment reduction of existing 
contracts.  The  Agency  has  multiple  opportunities  in  subsequent  Long-Term  Plans  to  make 
adjustments to REC prices, procurement targets, or other factors as more information becomes 
available that will allow for the Agency to ensure that a shortfall does not occur and that future 
budgets remain within that 95% target. Appendix B includes additional information showing how 
these current assumptions would extend through the 2042 delivery year. 
3.4.7.  Budget Uncertainty Due to Unknowns in Project Energization Timelines 
One challenge the Agency has faced in understanding pending budget impacts is that project 
energization and REC deliveries—and thus resultant budget impacts—are not scheduled to begin at 
a fixed point. Instead, supported projects may become energized at any point over a period of time, 
whether  immediately  upon  program  application,  closer  to  the  contractual  deadline  for  first 
deliveries, or later still due to extensions. This creates challenges into budget visibility in part because 
Adjustable Block Program projects carry large budget impacts upon energization: 15% of contract 
value for distributed generation projects above 25 kW up to 5,000 kW (“Large DG”) and Community-
Driven Community Solar; 100% of contract value for distribution generation up to 25 kW (“Small 
DG”).168 Because payment only commences upon project energization, the Agency cannot have 
certainty about when funds for specific projects will begin to be spent.  
This dynamic has proven to be a significant challenge in modeling budgets for present and future 
delivery years. Thankfully, this challenge has been mitigated by the changes to Section 16-108(k) of 
the PUA, including the ability for funds to be available for five years following collection (and utilized 
on a “first-in, first-out” basis) and walling off from reconciliation contractual obligations entered into 
but not yet paid. The timing of when a project is energized and thus starts receiving payments for 
RECs is now a less critical concern, as funds collected in prior years may now meet future years’ 
expenses even when those expenses are moderately delayed. However, the lumpiness of first 
payments could still create future constraints from a cash flow perspective. As indicated in Section 
3.5, flexibility with the use of utility-held ACPs creates a relief to that potential pressure. 
3.4.8.  Budget Uncertainty Due to Annual Load Variations 
The annual RPS Budget used in this 2022 Long-Term Plan has been developed using base case load 
forecasts provided by the utilities and each utility’s statutory cost cap. These load forecasts are driven 
 
167 For example, changing the assumed annual decrease in REC prices from 4% to 6% would eliminate that shortfall through the 2040s. 
168 Adjustable Block Program projects in the Traditional Community Solar and Public Schools categories pay for RECs over the life of the 
contract and are this structured more similarly to utility-scale REC delivery contracts.

by a number of factors, which include but are not limited to weather, economics, demographics, 
assumed demand response, and energy efficiency. Changes to any of the assumptions will result in 
actual load deviating from forecasted load. Examples include changes in weather patterns, changes 
in energy efficiency adoption rates, and changes to economic conditions. In practice, the annual RPS 
Budget for a delivery year will depend on the actual reference year load for each utility, which will 
likely deviate from the forecasted loads provided by the utilities—although in which direction that 
deviation will occur is impossible to know until that delivery year.  
To see how deviations from the Base Case load forecasts may affect available RPS budgets, the IPA 
conducted a comparative analysis of the RPS Budget based on the Base Case, High Case, and Low 
Case. Load forecast data for Ameren Illinois and ComEd were used for this analysis. The RPS Budget 
for each utility, for each load case, is based on the product of the Applicable Load for a given year and 
the cost cap rate shown in Figure 3-8.169 For each utility, the impact of the High Case and Low Case is 
the difference between the RPS budget for each case and the RPS Budget for the Base Case. The total 
is the sum of the differences for these utilities.

Low Load Effect on RPS Budget [$] High Load Effect on RPS Budget [$]
Low Load Forecast [MWh] High Load Forecast [MWh]
 
As shown in Figure 3-4 above, the impact of the low load forecast on the RPS Budget ranges from a 
reduction compared to the base case RPS Budgets of approximately $5.1 million in delivery year 
2021-2022 to a reduction of approximately $16 million in delivery year 2025-2026. Alternatively, 
the impact of the high load forecast on the RPS Budget ranges from an increase compared to the base 
case  RPS  Budgets  of  approximately  $7 million  in  delivery  year  2021-2022  to  an  increase  of 
approximately $16.7 million in delivery year 2025-2026. This constitutes a +/- 2 to 3.5% error band 
on annual RPS collections.  
The scale of load forecast uncertainty increases the further out forecasts are made, as factors such as 
economic indicators and climate/weather are compounded and inherently difficult to predict. That

increasing uncertainty underscores the need for careful consideration as the Agency considers the 
impact of procurements and programs on future year budgets. 
3.5. Alternative Compliance Payment Funds Held by the Utilities  
As of August 23, 2022, Ameren Illinois held $12,959,933 and ComEd held $23,982,074 of alternative 
compliance payments collected from retail customers that took service under electric utilities' hourly 
pricing tariff or tariffs (“HACP”). These funds are in part committed to fund the REC purchases from 
the 2015 through 2017 Distributed Generation procurements conducted by the Agency, which 
featured five-year REC delivery contracts with payment upon delivery (and not prepayment).170  
As of  August 23, 2022, the remaining balance of uncommitted hourly alternative compliance 
payments—those not set aside to fund the Distributed Generation procurements—is $12,959,933 for 
Ameren Illinois, and $ 21,197,584 for ComEd.  
Also, as of August 23, 2022, Ameren Illinois held $23,519,406, ComEd held $42,874,362, and 
MidAmerican held $13,556 of alternative compliance payment funds collected from ARES since June 
1, 2017 (“ARES ACP”)171 as shown in Table 3-22. 
The Tables below summarize the balances of these Alternative Compliance Payments.

In its First Revised Plan, the Agency proposed, and the ICC accepted, that the utility held ACPs should 
be used in each delivery year after the use of funds collected pursuant to Section 16-108(k) for both 
Forward Procurements and the Adjustable Block Program, providing the Agency with a reserve 
balance  of  funds  through  which  it  could  cover  expenditures  in  excess  of  Section  16-108(k) 
collections. This approach was necessary to minimize the risk of payment deferrals in the 2021-2022 
delivery year and the two years directly thereafter, during which the Available Net RPS Budget had 
 
170 2016 and 2017 Distributed Generation procurements for MidAmerican were funded out of MidAmerican’s Renewable Energy Resources 
budget, as MidAmerican does not have any Hourly Alternative Compliance Payments. 
171 Section 16-115D of the PUA provides that while “[t]hrough May 31, 2017, all alternative compliance payments by alternative retail 
electric suppliers shall be deposited in the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resources Fund,” “beginning with the delivery year 
commencing June 1, 2017, all alternative compliance payments by alternative retail electric suppliers shall be remitted to the applicable 
electric utility” and not deposited into the RERF. (220 ILCS 5/16-115D(d)(4), (4.5).)  See also 83 Ill Adm. Code Part 455. ComEd’s balance 
reflects interest earned on the ARES ACP funds held by ComEd, while Ameren Illinois’ and MidAmerican’s do not.

been projected to be negative, meaning that absent this change to the use of utility-held ACPs, 
contractual expenditures would need to be pulled back (under curtailment clauses in the REC 
contracts) from what was committed in order to bring the Available Net RPS Budget for the delivery 
year to zero.  
With the delays in project energization created by the COVID-19 pandemic, it appeared in 2021 that, 
even with the use of utility-held ACPs, contract payment deferrals could occur, thus resulting the IPA 
petitioning the ICC to reopen Docket No. 19-0995 for authorizing a payment deferral system.  While 
the enactment of Public Act 102-0662 has alleviated those near-term budgetary concerns, the full 
budgetary impact of the changes to the RPS are not fully known or understood. As a result, for this 
2022 Long-Term Plan, the Agency will maintain the approach of holding utility-held ACPs in reserve. 
The Agency will consider alternative uses of utility-held ACPs to maximize their impact on increasing 
RPS activities in its next Long-Term Plan.  
3.6. Section 1-75(c)(1)(H)(i) ARES Option to Supply RECs for their Retail Customers 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(H) of the Act provides an exception to the phase-out of ARES RPS obligations 
described in Section 3.1. Under this exception, an ARES may use self-supplied RECs to meet a portion 
(and possibly all) of the REC procurement requirements applicable to its load. To do so, the ARES had 
to first make an informational filing to the ICC within 45 days of the effective date of Public Act 99-
0906 (i.e., within 45 days of June 1, 2017), indicating that it owned a generating facility or facilities 
as of December 31, 2015, that produced RECs eligible to meet the RPS, provided that those facilities 
were not powered by wind or solar photovoltaics.  
The  amount  of  RECs  that  can  be  supplied  by  ARES-owned/  generation  is  subject  to  several 
limitations. Specifically, the Act provides that: 
For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2018, the maximum amount of renewable energy 
credits to be supplied by an alternative retail electric supplier under this subparagraph 
(H) shall be 68% multiplied by 25% multiplied by 14.5% multiplied by the amount of 
metered  electricity  (megawatt-hours)  delivered  by  the  alternative  retail  electric 
supplier to Illinois retail customers during the delivery year ending May 31, 2016.  
For delivery years beginning June 1, 2019 and each year thereafter, the maximum 
amount of renewable energy credits to be supplied by an alternative retail electric 
supplier under this subparagraph (H) shall be 68% multiplied by 50% multiplied by 
16% multiplied by the amount of metered electricity (megawatt-hours) delivered by the 
alternative retail electric supplier to Illinois retail customers during the delivery year 
ending May 31, 2016, provided that the 16% value shall increase by 1.5% each delivery 
year thereafter to 25% by the delivery year beginning June 1, 2025, and thereafter the 
25% value shall apply to each delivery year. 172 
The Act limits the total amount of RECs that can be supplied by all ARES through owned generation: 
For each delivery year, the total amount of renewable energy credits supplied by all 
alternative retail electric suppliers shall not exceed 9% of the Illinois target renewable 
energy credit quantity. The Illinois target renewable energy credit quantity for the

delivery year beginning June 1, 2018 is 14.5% multiplied by the total amount of metered 
electricity (megawatt-hours) delivered in the delivery year immediately preceding that 
delivery year, provided that the 14.5% shall increase by 1.5% each delivery year 
thereafter to 25% by the delivery year beginning June 1, 2025, and thereafter the 25% 
value shall apply to each delivery year.173 
To account for this self-supply by the ARES, the Act requires that charges applicable to retail 
customers of that ARES be reduced by the ratio of the RECs supplied by the ARES to the ARES’s RPS 
target. Specifically, the Act states that: 
If the requirements set forth in items (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph (H) are met, 
the charges that would otherwise be applicable to the retail customers of the alternative 
retail electric supplier under paragraph (6) of this subsection (c) for the applicable 
delivery year shall be reduced by the ratio of the quantity of renewable energy credits 
supplied by the alternative retail electric supplier compared to that supplier's target 
renewable  energy  credit  quantity.  The  supplier's  target  renewable  energy  credit 
quantity for the delivery year beginning June 1, 2018 is 14.5% multiplied by the total 
amount of metered electricity (megawatt-hours) delivered by the alternative retail 
supplier in that delivery year, provided that the 14.5% shall increase by 1.5% each 
delivery year thereafter to 25% by the delivery year beginning June 1, 2025, and 
thereafter the 25% value shall apply to each delivery year.174 
The ARES must also notify the Agency and the applicable utility by February 28 of each year of its 
election to supply RECs to its retail customers and include the amount of RECs to be supplied. By 
April 1 of each year, the IPA posts a report to its website outlining on the aggregate number of RECs 
being supplied by the ARES for the upcoming delivery year under this provision, starting June 1.175 
This quantity is accounted for as RECs from “other technologies” (i.e., other than wind or solar) and 
reduces the overall RPS Target for that delivery year. Those targets are shown (unadjusted) in Table 
3-6. 
One ARES informational filing, covering an eligible ARES-owned generation facility located outside 
of Illinois, was submitted on a confidential basis to the ICC by the deadline of July 15, 2017.  
3.7. MidAmerican Volumes 
While procurement plans are required to be prepared annually for Ameren Illinois and ComEd, 
Section 16-111.5(a) of the PUA states that “[a] small multi-jurisdictional electric utility . . . may elect 
to procure power and energy for all or a portion of its eligible Illinois retail customers” in accordance 
with the planning and procurement provisions found in the IPA Act. On April 9, 2015, MidAmerican 
first formally notified the IPA of its intent to procure power and energy for a portion of its eligible 
retail customer load through the IPA through its participation. That portion is essentially the 
incremental load that is not forecasted to be supplied in Illinois by what MidAmerican, a vertically-
integrated utility in Iowa that owns generation there (as well as a share of the Quad Cities nuclear

plant in Cordova, Illinois), assigns to Illinois as its jurisdictional generation. Each year since, 
MidAmerican has remained a part of that process to meet the remaining “portion” of its load.   
MidAmerican’s status as a multi-jurisdictional utility that uses its own generating resources to meet 
a portion of its Illinois load creates a unique situation for RPS compliance. Unlike Ameren Illinois and 
ComEd, for which all retail load is subject to the RPS goals and targets (subject to limited exceptions 
outlined above), the MidAmerican load for which the RPS goals and targets are applicable has 
traditionally been only that load that is subject to the IPA’s annual planning and procurement process 
for conventional power. As mentioned above, that amount has been the forecast load in excess of 
MidAmerican’s Illinois-allocated generation in any given delivery year, which has generally been only 
25-35% of its total jurisdictional load.176  
As a significantly smaller Illinois utility to begin with, and with only a portion of its load applicable to 
the Illinois RPS, the MidAmerican share of Illinois RPS and Zero Emission standard contracts has 
often been only a fraction of that allocated to ComEd and Ameren Illinois.    
3.7.1.  Initial Change to MidAmerican’s Load Forecast Methodology 
In 2018, MidAmerican proposed and the Commission approved a change in approach to forecast 
MidAmerican’s generation used for electricity procurement.177 This change caused a sudden and 
significant reduction of the load subject to the IPA electricity procurement process, as seen in Table 
3-15 below.

In the 2019 Electricity Procurement Plan,180 the IPA explained the change in approach to forecast 
MidAmerican’s generation: 
 
176 The Commission specified this approach for the procurement of renewable resources to meet the RPS compliance targets applicable 
to MidAmerican in Docket No. 15-0541, determining that only the portion of MidAmerican’s load subject to the IPA’s planning and 
procurement process is subject to Section 1-75(c) of the Act’s requirements.

In reviewing the load forecast and resource portfolio information supplied by MidAmerican for 
the 2019 Plan, the IPA notes that MidAmerican revised the methodology used for its generation 
supply forecast. The prior forecast methodology utilized production cost models to dispatch the 
Illinois Historical Resources whenever the expected cost to generate electricity is less than the 
expected cost of acquiring it in the market. The revised methodology is based on the utilization 
of  MISO  Unforced  Capacity  (“UCAP”)  from  the  baseload  Illinois  Historical  Resources  to 
determine the generation available to meet MidAmerican’s Illinois eligible load.181 
MidAmerican’s revised methodology utilizes the full capability of each baseload generation 
asset, represented by the UCAP MW values as determined by MISO for each year’s Planning 
Resource  Auction.  The  UCAP  values  de-rate  generating  unit  capabilities  by  considering 
historical forced outage rates and operating conditions under summer peak conditions. The IPA, 
for the 2019 Plan, recommends no changes to the determination of monthly on-peak and off-
peak block energy requirements other than the replacement of generation production values 
with the UCAP values for each of the following baseload resources: 
•  Coal resources including: Neal Unit #3, Neal Unit #4, Walter Scott Unit #3, Louisa 
Generating Station, and Ottumwa Generating Station. 
•  Nuclear Resources: Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station. 
The supply capability that is determined is netted against the forecast of MidAmerican Illinois 
load to calculate the monthly on-peak and off-peak shortfalls which will be met with energy 
block purchases in the IPA procurements. In determining the amount of block energy products 
to be procured for MidAmerican, the IPA treats the allocation of capacity and energy from 
MidAmerican’s Illinois Historical Resources in a manner analogous to a series of standard 
energy blocks. This approach is consistent with the 2018 Procurement Plan approved by the 
Commission. 
As shown in Table 3-15 above, one unintended consequence of this reduction is that it would cause 
the  annual  commitments  of  already  procured  RECs  and  associated  spending  to  exceed 
MidAmerican’s projected RPS annual budget using the prior-applied methodology for determining 
that budget amount. Stated differently, MidAmerican was previously assigned contracts assuming it 
would have ~$650,000 available to spend annually on renewable energy procurement. Upon those 
obligations becoming due and payments needing to be made, applying MidAmerican’s new load 
forecasting methodology in combination with the prior approach to determining MidAmerican’s RPS 
budget would result in MidAmerican only potentially having hundreds of dollars available for 
renewable energy resource procurement.  
This could have left entities holding contracts with MidAmerican at risk of non-payment, as absent 
an alternative interpretation to calculating MidAmerican’s available RPS budget, MidAmerican would 
not be authorized to meet those contract obligations without exceeding its statutory RPS rate impact 
cap. This situation could have caused some new renewable energy facilities dependent on revenue 
from MidAmerican’s contracts to suffer losses, leaving them potentially unable to generate enough 
revenue to cover costs.  
 
181 MidAmerican allocates 10.86% of the UCAP ratings of its baseload units for Illinois Historical Generation.

3.7.2.  Correcting for the Unintended Consequences of MidAmerican’s Forecast 
Approach 
As described in more detail throughout Chapter 2, a primary objective informing Public Act 99-
0906’s reforms to the Illinois RPS was to reduce year-over-year funding volatility that effectively 
paralyzed leveraging RPS funds to support the development of new renewable energy generation. 
While such volatility was not completely eliminated, year-over-year RPS annual budget changes for 
those utilities remain relatively minor, and enough stabilization was introduced to allow for the 
execution  of  the  types  of  long-term  contracts  providing  sufficient  revenue  certainty  to  allow 
developers to secure financing to develop new renewable generation. To ensure similar stability for 
MidAmerican’s budgets, in the First Revised Plan, the IPA proposed and the Commission accepted 
the use of a proxy to calculate MidAmerican’s Applicable Load. This proxy for applicable load is a 
percentage of MidAmerican’s total Illinois retail load.  
MidAmerican’s Applicable Load for the purposes of RPS compliance (i.e., calculations of REC targets, 
budgets, and allocation of REC contracts in this Plan) is to be fixed at 26.025% of MidAmerican’s 
annual total Illinois retail load. This percentage is calculated as follows: the average of MidAmerican’s 
applicable load from the Initial Plan for the DYs 2019-2020 through 2037-2038 is 526,880 MWh. The 
average of the total retail load provided by MidAmerican in their July 2019 data response for the 
same period is 2,024,484 MWh. The ratio of the average applicable load from the Initial Plan to the 
average total retail load provided by MidAmerican in its data response yields a 26.025% proxy.   
Adopting this proposal produces Applicable Load volumes that are equivalent to those used in the 
Initial Plan, as shown on Table 3-15, which formed the basis to calculate MidAmerican’s targets and 
budgets that supported MidAmerican’s allocation of REC contracts and corresponding spending. 
Additionally, as can be observed in the Table below, MidAmerican’s resulting Applicable Load and 
corresponding budget is relatively stable, year over year, helping to ensure not only that existing 
contracts are not curtailed, but also that the year to year volatility does not persist for MidAmerican.  
As  this  proposal  was  uncontested  in  Docket No.  19-0995,  this  proposal  was  adopted  by  the 
Commission through its Final Order in that proceeding approving the First Revised Plan. This 
approach has been maintained for this 2022 Long-Term Plan.

4. Renewable Energy Credit Eligibility  
4.1. Introduction 
To be eligible for use in compliance with the Illinois RPS, RECs are required to meet a variety of 
eligibility requirements. First, the RECs are to be sourced from generating technologies permitted in 
the  definition of “renewable  energy  resources”  contained in  Section  1-10  of  the  Act. Second, 
Subsections (I) and (J) of Section 1-75(c)(1) create additional eligibility criteria. Subsection (I) 
contains locational eligibility criteria, while subsection (J) contains criteria related to how a facility 
that generates RECs recovers its costs.  
This Chapter discusses how the Agency interprets and implements the requirements of Subsections 
(I) and (J).  Through P.A. 102-0662, changes were made to Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) and (J) of the Act 
providing support for RECs associated with electricity transmitted across qualifying high voltage 
direct current (“HVDC”) lines and electricity transmitted to Illinois-based HVDC converter stations; 
those changes are discussed in Section 4.5 below.    
4.2.  REC Eligibility 
Outside of these HVDC-related changes, P.A. 102-0662 does not otherwise change the process for 
determining the eligibility to participate in the Agency’s competitive procurements for utility-scale 
projects that are located in the states adjacent to Illinois.   
P.A. 99-0906 placed two new-at-the-time conditions on RECs eligible to be used for RPS compliance. 
1.  A locational standard that allows for RECs from facilities located in Illinois to meet the Illinois 
RPS, and from facilities located in adjacent states only if those facilities meet the public 
interest criteria set out in Section 1-75(c)(1)(I). By implication, RECs from states further 
afield than the states adjacent to Illinois would not qualify for the Illinois RPS.   
2.  P.A. 99-0906 introduced a new standard related to how generating units recover their costs.  
This standard not only prohibits the use of RECs from generating units that recover their 
costs through state-regulated rates, but also assesses penalties for RECs from systems later 
found to be non-compliant.182 
These eligibility requirements require competitive procurements conducted by the IPA to feature 
additional steps to verify that RECs being procured (and, in most cases, the underlying generating 
facilities from which they are being procured) are indeed eligible for the Illinois RPS.  Additional 
review  is  now  required  during  the  bidder  registration  process  to  allow  the  Procurement 
Administrator and the Agency to verify information about proposed facilities and if facilities located 
in the states adjacent to Illinois meet the public interest criteria.   
4.3.  Adjacent State Requirement  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) of the Act contains a locational eligibility requirement for the Illinois RPS. 
Enacted through P.A. 99-0906, this requirement replaced the prior locational standard under which 
 
182 See 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(J). Note that Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) references “facility” and “facilities” for the geographic standard, while 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(J) references “generating unit” for the cost recovery standard. Section 1-10 of the IPA Act does not specifically define 
“generating unit” but does define a facility as, “an electric generating unit or a co-generating unit that produces electricity along with related 
equipment necessary to connect the facility to an electric transmission or distribution system.” The Agency understands these terms to be 
generally interchangeable.

renewable energy resources could come from Illinois and adjoining states, and if not available, then 
they could come from elsewhere.183 By contrast, Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) permits that qualifying 
renewable energy credits can be generated by facilities located in Illinois, and may be sourced from 
facilities in adjacent184 states—but only if these facilities can meet public interest criteria spelled out 
in the law. While not explicitly stated in the statute, the Agency understands that the application of 
the public interest criteria for only adjacent states means that renewable energy credits from 
generating facilities located in states that are not adjacent to Illinois (or from generating facilities in 
other countries) will generally not be eligible for the Illinois RPS.185 
The public interest criteria that the Agency considers include:  
1.  Minimizing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and other pollution that 
adversely affects public health in this State 
2.  Increasing fuel and resource diversity in this State 
3.  Enhancing the reliability and resiliency of the electricity distribution system in this State

The Act specifies that the Agency “may qualify renewable energy credits from facilities located in 
states adjacent to Illinois if the generator demonstrates and the Agency determines that the operation 
of such facility or facilities will help promote the State's interest in the health, safety, and welfare of 
its residents based on the public interest criteria described above.”186  
To do so, and to “ensure that the public interest criteria are applied to the procurement and given full 
effect,” the Plan “shall describe in detail how each public interest factor shall be considered and 
weighted for facilities located in states adjacent to Illinois.” This Chapter provides that description.187   
In originally developing a methodology for considering and weighting these public interest criteria, 
the Agency faced certain challenges. The complex nature of an interconnected electric power grid 
and associated system operations (i.e., generation dispatch for economics and reliability), and how 
pollution flows across states, all prevented the Agency from simply quantifying and scoring facility 
eligibility requests using easily obtainable data. While predictions can be simulated, there is not one 
clear, unassailable way to determine how a renewable energy facility in an adjacent state will meet 
the public interest criteria.  
 
183 Former 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(3), repealed June 1, 2017. 
184 For the purpose of assessing eligibility for compliance with the Illinois RPS, the Agency defines only states that have a common border 
as states adjacent to Illinois:  Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan. Michigan is considered adjacent due to the border 
between Illinois and Michigan that exists in Lake Michigan. This is consistent with how other State Agencies interpret the federal Coastal 
Zone Management Act. See, for example, https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/cmp/documents/3_boundary.pdf. 
185   One exception introduced through P.A. 102-0662 is for projects utilizing qualifying HVDC transmission lines with converter stations 
located in Illinois.  As described in Section 4.5 below, the RECs associated with any renewable energy transmitted over that HVDC 
transmission line with a verified customer in Illinois will be deemed to have been sourced from a generation facility in Illinois for purposes 
of RPS qualification.   
186 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(I) (emphasis added). 
187 Separately, Chapter 5 describes how adjacent state projects that qualify under this public interest criteria scoring may comply with 
prevailing wage requirements found in Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q) of the IPA Act.

95,103,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
In its Initial Plan, the Agency developed what it believes are reasonable proxies for each criterion.188 
In the Final Order approving the Initial Plan on April 3, 2018 in Docket No. 17-0838, the Commission 
found the Agency’s methodology and assumptions for considering the eligibility of RECs sourced 
from adjacent states to be reasonable.  That approach remained the same for the First Revised Plan 
approved by the ICC on February 18, 2020 in Docket No. 19-0995, and no party contested the First 
Revised Plan’s approach through that proceeding.  This approach, described in more detail below, is 
generally unchanged in this 2022 Long-Term Plan.   
While based conceptually on the same approach used for the Agency’s Zero Emission Standard 
(“ZES”) Plan, the basis for determining compliance with the pollution and emissions public interest 
criteria in this Plan is focused on the displacement of potential new non-renewable gas-fired 
generation by renewable generation that could be eligible to supply RECs to meet the Illinois RPS 
requirements. Among the differences from the ZES Plan scoring approach are that renewable 
generating facilities are likely to be intermittent rather than baseload (a defining characteristic of 
zero emission facilities), typically impact generation on the margin of the dispatch order, and are 
generally smaller in size relative to the ZES replacement generation.   
To assess whether a renewable generating facility located in an adjacent state is eligible to participate 
in the IPA’s REC procurements to meet the Illinois RPS, the Agency assigns a maximum of 20 points 
to each of the five public interest criteria, as described below, for a total of 100 possible points.  
For a renewable energy generating facility in an adjacent state to have its RECs considered eligible 
for the Illinois RPS, the adjacent state facility needs to demonstrate that it can achieve a total score of 
at least 60 points for the Agency to approve that request. The IPA believes that this score threshold, 
previously affirmed by the ICC in Docket No. 17-0838, provides a balanced approach to ensuring that 
adjacent state facilities indeed provide sufficient benefits consistent with the law’s directive. This 
score threshold requires a better than average score demonstrating benefits to the health, safety, and 
welfare of Illinois residents, but yet not too onerous to prohibit any adjacent state participation. 
For this 2022 Long-Term Plan, the Agency has reviewed and analyzed not only this scoring threshold, 
but also the methodology for the consideration of adjacent state facilities.  After review and analysis, 
this scoring threshold and methodology (described further below) remains the same as presented in 
the Initial Plan and First Revised Plan.  However, the Agency has updated the data for the inputs 
related to wind direction and duration used in the methodology.     
The Agency also notes that there are two wind facilities in adjacent states that were the recipients of 
contracts from the 2010 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement. One in Iowa has a contract 
with Ameren, while one in Indiana has a contract with ComEd. As these facilities were granted 
contracts at a time that Illinois law viewed them as providing sufficient benefits to Illinois residents 
for their renewable energy resources to be used to meet the Illinois RPS, the Agency considers these 
two facilities to be grandfathered into this requirement.  
1.  Minimizing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and other pollution that 
adversely affects public health in this State 
 
188 The Agency also developed a similar set of criteria for use in its Zero Emission Standard Procurement Plan (“ZES Plan”) developed 
pursuant to Section 1-75(d-5) of the Act, which was approved by the Commission on September 11, 2017 in Docket No. 17-0333. That ZES 
Plan includes consideration of how to minimize sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter emissions that would result from the 
potential closure of zero emission facilities (i.e., nuclear plants located in PJM or MISO).

For  the  purposes  of  its  Initial  Plan  (and  maintained  in  this  2022  Long-Term  Plan)  and  the 
consideration of this criterion, the Agency refined and simplified the methodological approach 
utilized in the ZES Plan. Under the ZES Plan, emissions are associated with replacement of generation 
that can be located anywhere in PJM or MISO; for the purposes of this 2022 Long-Term Plan, the 
Agency considers that a renewable energy facility would displace the emissions of a typical new 
natural gas-fired combined-cycle generation facility. 
In the ZES Plan, the Agency weighted replacement generation across multiple states, in recognition 
that replacement generation for a large Zero Emission Facility would likely come from multiple 
sources (replacement generation would be a combination of changed dispatch of existing generation 
units as well as the potential development of new generating units). 189 The Agency simplified the 
weighting for this criterion to focus on comparing emissions from renewable generation to the 
emissions from a new natural gas-fired combined-cycle generating facility. This assumption reflects 
the  fact  that  recent  and  anticipated  additions  to  the  resource  mix in  PJM  and  MISO  will  be 
predominantly natural gas, wind or solar190 and natural gas is increasingly the fuel on the margin for 
both PJM and MISO, and thus more appropriate for comparison than, say, a baseload coal facility.191 
As discussed below, this comparison is a relevant factor in the evaluation criteria for renewable 
technologies that involve combustion (thus not including wind, solar, or hydro).  
The emissions comparison includes sulfur dioxide (SO ) and nitrogen oxides (NO ) as proxies for all 
2 x
emissions because higher emissions of SO  and NO  are generally correlated with higher emissions 
2 x
of PM, especially with regard to facilities that involve the combustion of solid fuels. SO  and NO are 
2 x 
primary emission sources for the formation of PM  in ambient air away from the immediate 
2.5
emissions source. Larger PM (PM ) is deposited nearer the source, while secondary PM  increases 
10 2.5
based on the formation of sulfates and nitrates from the SO  and NO  in the atmosphere as the 
2 x
pollutants move away from the primary source.192 The following table shows SO , NO , and CO

Information Agency (“EIA”). 193 
   
 
189 Specifically, 33% of the replacement generation was assumed to be in the bidding zero emission facility’s own state, and the remaining 
67% of replacement generation was assumed to occur across the relevant RTO, allocated by states based on each state’s share of RTO-wide 
generation.  ZES Plan, July 31, 2017, https://www.icc.illinois.gov/downloads/public/edocket/451223.pdf, at 37.

The score is calculated by multiplying an emissions factor for the renewable resource facility (scaled 
from 0 to 1) by a wind duration/direction factor (scaled from 0 to 1) and then by 20 points to 
determine the number of points awarded for this criterion. 
The emissions factor is calculated by taking one minus: the sum of the eligible renewable resource’s 
SO and NO  emissions in pounds/MWh divided by the sum of the SO  and NO  emissions from a new 
2  x 2 x
natural gas-fired combined-cycle generation facility in pounds/MWh.   
The emissions factor for wind or solar generating facilities, which do not emit SO , NO , or Particulate 
2 x
Matter, would be 1.0 because those facilities would have zero in the numerator of the part of the 
equation that is subtracted from one.  The focus of the competitive procurements covered in this 
2022 Long-Term Plan is on utility-scale wind and solar projects as well as brownfield site solar 
projects.  Other renewable generating facilities including technologies that rely on combustion of a 
renewable resource are not specifically addressed in the adjacent state eligibility requirements for 
these competitive procurements.   
The Zero Emission Standard Plan included consideration of wind direction and duration as well as 
the distance from Illinois to modify the emissions criteria scoring. In scoring the emissions related 
public interest criterion, the Agency and simplified the wind duration/direction approach compared 
to what was utilized in the Zero Emission Standard Plan. For this 2022 Long-Term Plan, the IPA has 
updated the wind data from what was used in the Initial and First Revised Plans. Since the renewable 
generating facilities supplying RECs from outside of Illinois must be located in the states adjacent to 
Illinois (as opposed to anywhere within PJM and MISO under the Zero Emission Standard), the 
distance of the emission source from Illinois is less important for this Plan compared to the Zero 
Emission Standard, and thus is not considered in the approach adopted for this 2022 Long-Term Plan.

The wind duration factor is based on the percentage of the time the wind blows into Illinois from 16 
directional sectors that form all of the directions in 360 degrees around Illinois. The wind direction 
and duration factors were developed based on 25 years of consistent climatological data. On average 
this data is relatively stable over time, although at some point in the future climate change could 
impact the data underlying the determination of these factors. For example, the wind blowing from 
Indiana would encompass seven directional sectors from which the wind blows on average 25.6 
percent of the time. Thus, for example, a solar facility located in Indiana would receive 1 x 0.318 x 20 
or 6.36 points. The following equation shows how this score is obtained (with the caveat that the 
minimum possible score is zero and cannot be a negative score):195

The Agency’s review of the scoring methodology for this criterion showed that the analytical 
approach remains valid for this 2022 Long-Term Plan. However, the wind duration/direction factors 
have been updated to include 25 years of consistent data reported by the Illinois State Water Survey, 
Water and Atmospheric Resource Monitoring Program from 17 reporting stations located around 
the state for the years 1996 through 2020196 (rather than the period 1996 through 2016 included in 
the Initial and First Revised Plans).   
2.  Increasing fuel and resource diversity in this State 
Fuel and resource diversity generally refers to the use of a balanced group of generating facilities and 
technologies which results in reducing the risk that a specific technology could adversely impact 
overall system reliability. For example, PJM defines fuel diversity as: utilizing multiple resource types 
to meet demand such that a sufficiently diversified system is expected to provide the flexibility and 
adaptability to: “1) mitigate risk associated with equipment design issues or common modes of 
failure in similar resource types, 2) address fuel price volatility and fuel supply disruptions, and 3) 
reliably mitigate instabilities caused by weather and other unforeseen system shocks.”197 In effect, 
fuel and resource diversity can act as a hedge to help ensure a stable and reliable supply of electricity.   
Any generation source that promotes more reliance on generation sources other than coal and 
nuclear, which in 2020 had generation shares of 17.9% and 57.8% of Illinois’ total generation 
respectively,198 would contribute to increasing fuel and resource diversity in Illinois. By this measure, 
any of the eligible renewable energy resource generating technologies would contribute to diversity 
in Illinois. However, if these facilities were located outside of Illinois, in the adjacent states, the full 
 
195 See Docket No. 17-0838, Final Order dated April 3, 2018 at 21.

198 U.S. EIA, “Electric Power Monthly with data for December 2020, February 2021.” The Agency notes that the share of coal declined from 
38% and share of nuclear increased from 50.2% as reported in the Initial Plan. This is a net decline in the percentage of generation that 
comes from coal and nuclear (88.2% to 76%), which indicates that the fuel and resource diversity of the state has increased.

99,107,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
impact on the State’s fuel and resource diversity would depend on whether the electricity generated 
by these facilities could actually be available to Illinois end-users.   
Given that renewable generation accounts for only a relatively small fraction of the resource mix in 
Illinois (10.2% of total generation in 2020),199 an increase of renewable generation in the region may, 
in theory, increase the fuel and resource diversity of Illinois. However, the Agency notes that Illinois 
is a net exporter of electricity, so the impact on fuel and resource diversity in Illinois may be limited 
for facilities located in adjacent states. While Illinois is a net exporter of electricity, that does not 
mean that there is no impact on Illinois from electricity generated in adjacent states, because on an 
hour-to-hour basis electricity may flow into, or out of, Illinois. To the extent that any electricity 
generated outside of Illinois but consumed in the state is generated by resources other than coal or 
nuclear, this generation is assumed to add to the fuel and resource diversity in Illinois.   
 
In addressing this issue for facilities located in the adjacent states, the Agency uses the location of the 
renewable resource facility relative to Illinois as the basis for modifying the fuel and resource 
diversity score. A distance factor is calculated for each facility.200 The distance factor is based on the 
distance from the facility to Morris, Illinois (which is the city closest to the population weighted 
geographic center of Illinois,201 and thus can serve as a reasonable proxy for the load-weighted center 
of the state). The factor is calculated as 1 minus the ratio of (i) the distance from the facility to Morris 
and (ii) 470 miles, which is roughly the furthest point in an adjacent state from Morris. Consistent 
with the Commission’s Order in Docket No. 17-0838, the center point of the City of Morris is used for 
this calculation.202 That factor is multiplied by the maximum possible 20 points to provide the score 
for this criterion for potentially eligible renewable resource facilities located in adjacent states. The 
fuel and resource diversity score formula is shown in Figure 4-2.  
 
Additionally, consistent with the Commission’s Order in Docket No. 17-0838 and the approach taken 
with respect to the third criterion below, a facility “that is not connected to either PJM or MISO” will 
receive a Fuel and Resource Diversity Score of zero.203 Adjacent state generation facilities “within a 
transmission control area that have a transmission usage agreement with PJM or MISO” may still 
receive non-zero scores under Criteria 2 and 3, however.204

threshold, an adjacent state facility not connected to PJM or MISO would effectively be eliminated from consideration and no further scoring 
adjustments must be taken to give effect to the Commission’s intent.

3.  Enhancing the reliability and resiliency of the electricity distribution system in this 
State. 
While this criterion references the “electricity distribution system” and that term is generally 
understood to mean the local distribution system that serves homes and businesses and not the 
transmission grid that transports power over longer distances (and across state lines), the Agency 
was originally concerned that, read literally, there would be no direct way for a facility in an adjacent 
state to meet this criterion because a facility in an adjacent state would have (at best) only an 
incidental impact on the distribution system (or more accurately systems, each operated by a 
different utility) within Illinois. With that in mind, the Agency has come to interpret this criterion 
more expansively and instead considers the impact on the grid more generally, as distribution service 
is ultimately supported by the reliability of transmission service. The scoring for this public interest 
criterion involves a threshold and, based on the assumption that generating facilities located closer 
to Illinois would have a more beneficial impact on the State’s distribution system reliability and 
resiliency, a distance factor. The criterion can be understood to refer to the transmission systems 
operated by PJM and MISO. To the extent that a facility in an adjacent state is not interconnected to 
the PJM or MISO grid (for example, in the portions of Iowa and Missouri that are part of the Southwest 
Power Pool(“SPP”)), those facilities would not score any points for this criterion. Otherwise, a facility 
in an adjacent state that is in either of the PJM or MISO control areas (or “within a transmission 
control area that has a transmission usage agreement with PJM or MISO”) would be eligible to receive 
points. To obtain the distance factor, the Agency uses an approach that considers proximity to Illinois 
and thus an increased likelihood that electricity produced will provide increased system reliability 
and resilience. 
The scoring for this public interest criterion involves the same distance factor as is applied to the fuel 
and resource diversity scoring; the formula for determining this factor is shown in Figure 4-3. The 
Agency’s review of the scoring methodology and assumptions for criteria 2 and 3 confirms that 
distance is the factor which can be effectively incorporated into a simplified approach to determine 
the relative contributions of RECs from adjacent state renewable resources to meeting these public 
interest criteria.

4.  Meeting goals to limit carbon dioxide emissions under federal or State law 
At the federal level, a range of legislative and regulatory approaches have been proposed to address 
the carbon dioxide emissions associated with the generation of electricity using fossil fuels.  On June 
19, 2019, the U.S. EPA issued the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE) as the replacement for the Clean 
Power Plan. The ACE focused on heat rate improvements at individual coal-fired power plants as a 
means to reduce CO  emissions by improving plant operating efficiency. ACE did not contain specific 
2
CO   emissions  limits;  instead,  ACE  provided  guidelines  for  states  to  follow  in  limiting  CO  
2 2
emissions.205 In January of 2021, the DC Circuit Court vacated ACE.206  As of the finalization of this

2022 Long-Term Plan, mandated reductions in CO  emissions and clean energy standards remain a 
2
topic of debate at the federal level. 
At the state level, Illinois does not have a specific law that limits carbon dioxide emissions.  However, 
there are multiple provisions of Illinois law, such as the Zero Emission Standard and the Renewable 
Energy Portfolio Standard, that recognize the value of minimizing carbon dioxide emissions even if 
those provisions do not create explicit limits.  P.A. 102-0662 also makes extensive references to the 
consideration  of  carbon  emission  reductions  and  the  benefits  associated  with  reducing  these 
emissions.  To recognize the value in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, the Agency determines the 
score for each renewable resource facility by adjusting the 20 points available for this criterion by a 
factor which reflects the ratio of the CO  emissions from the renewable resource to the CO  emissions 
2 2
from a new natural gas-fired combined cycle generating facility, 752 pounds of CO  per MWh, as 
2
shown in Table 4-1 above. This is done by using the formula applied to the first emissions criterion 
except that the inputs are pounds of CO  emitted per MWh. The factor applied to the 20 points 
2
available for this public interest criterion is calculated as follows:

Renewable generating facilities that do not emit any CO receive the full 20 points, while renewable 
2 
generating facilities that emit CO  receive points based on the factor multiplied by the 20 points. 
2
Because CO  emissions are generally considered to be a global problem (in that CO  emissions 
2 2
anywhere on the planet contribute to global warming, which then affects the health and welfare of 
the citizens of Illinois), wind direction, duration, and distance from Illinois’s load-weighted center 
are not relevant for the scoring of this criterion and therefore are not included in the calculation.207

alternative generation, usually a gas-fired combined-cycle plant, remains a practical means for 
determining the score for this criterion.     
5.  Contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment for the citizens of this State 
This criterion is arguably the most subjective in nature, and presents unique challenges given that 
the Agency strives to use objective approaches to the greatest extent possible when considering the 
public interest criteria. The Agency believes that renewable resources inherently contribute to a 
cleaner and healthier environment generally (with the caveat related to emissions from renewable 
resources that involve combustion, discussed above) because they reduce the reliance on fossil fuels 
and have no safety issues associated with the containment and disposal of radioactive materials that 
result from nuclear generation. Under this 2022 Long-Term Plan, the points awarded for this public 
interest criterion are the average of the points awarded under the first and fourth public interest 
 
207 The Agency notes that the Zero Emission Standard Plan contains a different scoring methodology for CO2 emissions, but that 
methodology is based upon the impacts of replacement generation and the consideration related to “minimizing carbon dioxide emissions 
that result from electricity consumed in Illinois” (20 ILCS 3855/1-75(d-5)(1)(C)), which is not the same standard as under consideration 
in qualifying adjacent-state facilities for the RPS.

criteria described above. This approach takes into account the emissions from renewable resource 
facilities that involve combustion and, subsequently, emissions, which would not contribute to a 
cleaner and healthier environment for the citizens of Illinois.  
4.4.  Cost Recovery Requirement 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(J) of the Act contains the following provision:   
In order to promote the competitive development of renewable energy resources in 
furtherance of the State's interest in the health, safety, and welfare of its residents, 
renewable energy credits shall not be eligible to be counted toward the renewable 
energy requirements of this subsection (c) if they are sourced from a generating unit 
whose costs were being recovered through rates regulated by this State or any other 
state or states on or after January 1, 2017. 
Generally speaking, the Agency understands that facilities owned by a rural electric cooperative, or 
a municipal utility are not impacted by this criterion (as in Illinois, those entities’ rates are not 
regulated by this state or any other), although the Agency notes that there are certain adjacent states 
which regulate some rural electric cooperative and municipal utility rates. Therefore, the Agency 
cannot issue a blanket approval under this provision of facilities owned by rural electric cooperatives 
or municipal utilities service territories in adjacent states; rather, as those facilities request eligibility, 
their rate recovery status will be reviewed.  
The Agency also understands that this provision was primarily intended to ensure that facilities 
owned by a vertically integrated utility, for which REC revenues may be incidental to building and 
financing the facility (as that facility’s costs could be recovered from ratepayers in that other state, 
potentially resulting in a credit or discount to those ratepayers for any REC revenues—effectively 
causing Illinois ratepayers to cross-subsidize those in vertically integrated states) would not be 
eligible.  Another situation that has been brought to the Agency’s attention concerns a proposed 
project to be developed by an Illinois non-electric utility (a gas or water utility, for instance) featuring 
delivery service rates that are regulated by the Illinois Commerce Commission with cost recovery 
then sought over the cost of the renewable energy generating facility.  Regardless of whatever may 
have been the primary purpose informing Section 1-75(c)(1)(J)’s enactment, this situation would 
seem to clearly fit Section 1-75(c)(1)(J)’s prohibition: the renewable generation facility’s costs would 
be recovered through state-regulated rates.  Consequently, the IPA understands such projects’ RECs 
as being barred from participation in the Illinois RPS (including in, say, the Adjustable Block 
Program) insofar as rate recovery is sought for those projects.   
On the other hand, the mere presence of a Power Purchase Agreement between a facility and a 
separate utility whose costs are recovered in regulated rates would not trigger these criteria (nor 
would participation in the IPA’s energy procurement events, for which regulated utilities serve as 
contractual counterparties, or participation in a net metering or similar energy crediting program, 
which would serve to disqualify the very facilities that other portions of the Illinois RPS work to 
support). Likewise, the Agency believes that being a Qualifying Facility under the Public Utility 
Regulatory Policies Act (“PURPA”)208 (and also meeting the other aspects of the requirements of the 
Illinois RPS), would not be disqualifying because the Qualifying Facility does not directly recover its 
 
208 16 U.S.C. §§ 796(17), 824a-3, 824i.

costs through rates; rather, it is compensated for its energy at the purchasing utility’s avoided cost 
rate. 
Facilities located in adjacent states must proactively request eligibility for the utility’s RPS pursuant 
to the public interest criteria standard explained above. Those requests to meet the public interest 
criteria are required to include a notarized certification, and documentation, that the facility does not 
have its costs recovered through regulated rates. For a distributed generation facility, simple 
documentation of ownership will suffice. For larger facilities, the Agency has not utilized a firm 
standard of documentation but believes there are multiple approaches that could be used by a 
requesting facility. These include, but are not limited to: 
•  For facilities tracked in M-RETS, documentation to support the status listed in the “Facility 
Ownership Type” field 
•  A Market Based Rate authorization letter from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
that demonstrates that the facility owner is not a utility with costs recovered through 
regulated rates 
•  Certification as a Qualifying Facility 
•  Use of information from other sources such as the S&P Global Intelligence Briefing Book, or 
the Platts UDI Directory of Electric Power Producers and Distributors 
The Agency will review (in consultation with the ICC) information provided for a facility, and may, as 
needed, request additional information to verify a facility’s status. 
In addition to the screening process described above, all contracts from IPA-administered REC 
procurements or programs utilized since the effective date of P.A. 99-0906 contain provisions to 
reflect this additional requirement of Section 1-75(c)(1)(J) (and will continue to do so going 
forward): 
Each contract executed to purchase renewable energy credits under this subsection (c) 
shall provide for the contract's termination if the costs of the generating unit supplying 
the  renewable  energy  credits  subsequently  begin  to  be  recovered  through  rates 
regulated by this State or any other state or states; and each contract shall further 
provide that, in that event, the supplier of the credits must return 110% of all payments 
received  under  the  contract.  Amounts  returned  under  the  requirements  of  this 
subparagraph (J) shall be retained by the utility and all of these amounts shall be used 
for the procurement of additional renewable energy credits from new wind or new 
photovoltaic resources as defined in this subsection (c). The long-term plan shall provide 
that these renewable energy credits shall be procured in the next procurement event. 
The Agency notes that Section 1-75(c)(1)(J) also provides a limited exception to this provision for 
facilities that participate in the Illinois Solar for All Program outlined in Section 1-56 of the Act:  
Notwithstanding the limitations of this subparagraph (J), renewable energy credits 
sourced from generating units that are constructed, purchased, owned, or leased by an 
electric utility as part of an approved project, program, or pilot under Section 1-56 of 
this Act shall be eligible to be counted toward the renewable energy requirements of this 
subsection (c), regardless of how the costs of these units are recovered.

4.5. High-Voltage Direct Current Transmission Lines and Converter Stations  
P.A. 102-0662 features multiple revisions to Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) and (J) intended to support utility-
scale renewable energy projects utilizing high-voltage direct current (“HVDC”) transmission lines 
and converter stations, providing a more expansive approach to qualifying adjacent state generating 
facilities than previously employed under Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) when certain criteria are met. 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) contains two changes resultant from P.A. 102-0662. 
1.  If (i) a new HVDC transmission line ends at a converter station located in Illinois and 
interconnected in the region of the PJM interconnection, (ii) was constructed using a project 
labor agreement, (iii) is capable of transmitting electricity at 525 kV, (iv) does not operate as 
a public utility, and (v) was  energized after June 1, 2023, then the RECs associated with any 
renewable energy transmitted over that HVDC transmission line with a verified customer in 
Illinois will be deemed to have been sourced from a generation facility in Illinois for purposes 
of RPS qualification.  This would make those RECs eligible for competitive procurements 
conducted by the IPA, even if the underlying generating facility itself was not located in 
Illinois (or an adjacent state) and could not meet the scoring threshold outlined above.209    
At present, there are no new HVDC transmission lines with converter stations located in 
  Illinois in operation, although there currently is a proposed project which could potentially 
  meet the requirements.210   
2.  Revisions to Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) also clarify that the Agency may qualify RECs “associated 
with  the  electricity  generated  by  a  utility-scale  wind  energy  facility  or  utility-scale 
photovoltaic facility and transmitted by a qualifying direct current project described in 
subsection (b-5) of Section 8-406 of the Public Utilities Act to a delivery point on the electric 
transmission grid located in this State or a state adjacent to Illinois,”211 but only if this 
Chapter’s public interest criteria scoring is satisfied.  As that electricity must be transmitted 
to “a delivery point . . . located in this State or a state adjacent to Illinois,” the IPA’s first-blush 
interpretation is that this delivery point should be treated as the location of the generating 
facility  in  public  interest  criteria  scoring.    While  the  Agency  appreciates  that  this 
interpretation may allow for participation from utility-scale wind and solar projects located 
further from Illinois than would otherwise be allowed (and those projects may offer lesser 
benefits back to Illinois residents and businesses), utilizing the location a of wind or solar 
project for public interest scoring would render this new statutory language meaningless, as 
projects utilizing qualifying direct current projects would be treated equivalently to those 
that did not.  
 
209 However, that facility would not be eligible if the generating facility’s costs were recovered through state-regulated rates, as that 
prohibition remains in effect even for in-state generation.   
210 The proposed SOO Green HVDC Link is a 350-mile, 2,100 MW, 525 kV underground HVDC transmission line which would run from 
Mason City, IA to Plano, IL along railroad rights-of-way.  Subject to permitting and interconnection issues, the line is projected to begin 
construction in 2023 and go into operation in 2026.   
211 Section 8-406(b-5) of the PUA defines a “qualifying direct current project” as  a ""high voltage direct current electric service line that 
crosses at least one Illinois border, the Illinois portion of which is physically located within the region of the Midcontinent Independent 
System Operator, Inc., or its successor organization, and runs through the counties of Pike, Scott, Greene, Macoupin, Montgomery, Christian, 
Shelby, Cumberland, and Clark, is capable of transmitting electricity at voltages of 345kv or above, and may also include associated 
interconnected alternating current interconnection facilities in this State that are part of the proposed project and reasonably necessary 
to connect the project with other portions of the grid.”

105,113,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(J) contains only one change enacted through P.A. 102-0662, now stating that “[a]s 
long as a generating unit or an identifiable portion of a generating unit has not had and does not have 
its costs recovered through rates regulated by this State or any other state, HVDC renewable energy 
credits212 associated with that generating unit or identifiable portion thereof shall be eligible to be 
counted” under the Illinois RPS.  The IPA understands this language as clarifying that, for HVDC 
renewable energy credits, whether the underlying generating facility has its costs recovered through 
state-regulated rates is what carries an RPS eligibility prohibition under subparagraph (J), but not 
whether the HVDC transmission line or converter station has its costs recovered through state-
regulated rates.   
4.6. Application Process  
The eligibility of RECs from renewable energy generating facilities located in states adjacent to 
Illinois is not automatically granted, because the Act requires that approval comes only after “the 
generator demonstrates and the Agency determines” that the facility’s operation meets the public 
interest criteria discussed above.213 That determination requires an active request (demonstration) 
by an interested generator. Renewable generating facilities in adjacent states may apply to the 
Agency for consideration for eligibility for the RPS.214  
Shortly after the approval of its Initial Plan, the Agency developed an application form (in the form 
of an Excel spreadsheet) for use by owners/agents of adjacent-state facilities that wish to have RECs 
from those projects considered to be eligible for the Illinois RPS.215 The information to be entered 
into the application form includes the generating technology (including information on emissions 
rates if the technology involves combustion), state where the generator is located, distance from the 
geographical center of Morris, IL, the Regional Transmission Organization (“RTO”) where the facility 
is interconnected or is planned to be interconnected (e.g., PJM, MISO, SPP), and the tracking system 
ID (for existing facilities). The application form automatically calculates the score for the facility. In 
addition, the generator must also include information related to the provision limiting the recovery 
of costs in rates described in this chapter.  
As discussed above, the Agency will continue to review and, as necessary, update the data used in the 
eligibility calculations on a bi-annual basis in conjunction with the new Plan update to use the most 
recent available inputs (and has done so for this 2022 Long-Term Plan, determining that minor 
changes are needed for the wind direction/duration factors), but a facility’s determination of 
eligibility will be based on the data available at the time of the request for determination (in other 
words, a facility would not risk having its eligibility revoked at a later date if the inputs changed after 
the initial eligibility determination is made by the Agency). 
The Agency will review applications to verify the information submitted (e.g., confirming the distance 
inputs), and if the facility has a score equal to or greater than 60 points (and meets the cost recovery 
requirement found in Section 1-75(c)(1)(J) of the Act, discussed further below), the Agency will 
 
212 Section 1-10 of the IPA Act defines “HVDC renewable energy credits” as RECs “associated with a renewable energy resource where the 
renewable energy resource has entered into a contract to transmit the energy associated with such renewable energy credit over high 
voltage direct current transmission facilities.”   
213 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(I). 
214 An exception is made for the out-of-state facilities that have LTPPA contracts with the utilities. As discussed in Section 4.3, those facilities 
are grandfathered in and remain eligible to provide RECs for compliance with the Illinois RPS.

106,114,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
approve the facility as eligible to produce renewable energy credits for compliance with the Illinois 
RPS. The Agency will inform the applicable tracking system (GATS or M-RETS) that the facility should 
be coded as Illinois RPS eligible.  
For facilities seeking to qualify by virtue of RECs associated with electricity transmitted across 
qualifying HVDC lines or transmitted to an HVDC converter station in Illinois, the Agency is still 
assessing what demonstration is necessary for qualification.  As the Agency would no longer be 
assessing the physical location of a project and would instead be making determinations around RECs 
associated with electricity transmitted to a certain point and in a certain manner, the Agency is 
continuing to assess how this new approach to RPS qualification can be integrated into its source-
specific competitive procurement processes. Until that process is formalized – and noting that 
applicable HVDC lines and transmission stations are apparently in the early stages of development – 
those requests will be handled within the context of individual procurement event qualification.216   
In the case of a new adjacent-state facility that is not yet operational (and thus also not registered in 
GATS or M-RETS), an owner may submit a request for determination of eligibility based upon the 
planned design of the facility. If the Agency determines that the planned facility does meet the public 
interest criteria, then it will grant a pre-approval of the eligibility. It is the responsibility of the facility 
owner to notify the IPA and the tracking system once the facility is operational to request being coded 
as eligible for the Illinois RPS in the applicable tracking system. The Agency will review final system 
information to verify consistency with the information submitted for the pre-approval.  
 
   
 
216 Perhaps notably, no party sought additional clarity around those HVDC-related qualification processes in ICC Docket No. 22-0231, the 
Commission’s proceeding approving this 2022 Long-Term Plan.

5. Competitive Procurements  
The Agency is charged with developing procurement plans and conducting competitive procurement 
processes in accordance with the requirements of Section 1-75 of the IPA Act and Section 16-111.5 
of the PUA.  The competitive procurement process is applicable to the events held by the Agency to 
obtain RECs from utility-scale wind, utility-scale solar and brownfield site photovoltaic resources.  
While the term “competitive procurement event” is not specifically defined in the IPA Act or the PUA, 
the  Agency  understands  the  term  “competitive  procurement  event”  to  be  an  element  of,  or 
commensurate with a “competitive procurement process.”   
This Chapter  addresses requirements  applicable  to  those competitive  procurement  processes, 
including changes to those processes necessitated by changes in Illinois law made through Public Act 
102-0662.  Among those changes are increases in RPS budgets and targets as outlined in Chapter 3 
(and  thus  corresponding  increases  in  procurement  quantities  from  competitive  procurement 
events), modifications to permissible bid application and evaluation requirements for supporting 
projects located in Energy Transition Community Grant areas and projects supporting equity eligible 
contractor participation, new labor requirements applicable to project development (including 
project labor agreements required for participating projects), and a new Indexed REC pricing 
approach through which REC prices float up or down based on indexed wholesale energy market 
prices, ensuring stable revenues across the delivery term of a REC delivery contract.   
Throughout this Chapter, the competitive procurements conducted by the Agency are termed as 
“forward procurements,” as they are procurements that have a delivery date in the future and the 
contract term is for multiple years.  
5.1. Background - Agency Approach in Past Procurements 
The procurement approach the Agency has used for prior REC procurements, including the Initial 
Forward Procurements and the forward procurements conducted under the Initial and First Revised 
Plans, stems from the approach laid out in Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act for “standard 
wholesale product” (i.e., block energy, capacity, etc.) procurements.  
This process has traditionally included the following key provisions, although modifications to 
governing law through P.A. 102-0662 will result in changes from certain aspects of this approach; 
those modifications are discussed later in this Chapter: 
•  Standard contracts and credit provisions 
•  Sealed bids with pay-as-bid settlement 
•  Use of confidential benchmarks to eliminate bids not consistent with the market 
•  Bid selection based on price  
•  No post-bid negotiations 
•  Procurement Administrator evaluates bids and provides confidential recommendation to the 
Commission for approval 
•  Procurement Administrator provide bidder interface including training 
•  Uniform/standardized bid forms 
•  Uniform/standardized/harmonized credit requirements 
•  Procurement Monitor involvement

108,116,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
These provisions define a procurement process that has multiple stages. 
•  The Procurement Administrator develops draft contracts in consultation with the utilities, 
the Agency, the Procurement Monitor,217 and ICC Staff.   
•  Draft contracts are released for public comment. 
•  The Procurement Administrator, the Agency, the utilities, ICC Staff and the Procurement 
Monitor review all comments received on the draft contract and revise the contract as 
needed.218 
•  Typically, the Procurement Administrator holds an informational webcast upon release of 
the final contracts and RFP rules.  
•  Submission of Proposals is in two parts: 
o  Part 1 for pre-qualification – allows bidders to provide basic information and agree 
to the terms of the contract and the RFP rules. 
o  Part 2 for registration of bidders – allows bidders to update information, make 
additional certifications including regarding confidentiality of bidding information, 
and post bid assurance collateral. 
•  Bids – on the bid date, bidders submit bids using a standardized bid form. 
•  Evaluation  of  Bids  –  the  Procurement  Administrator  evaluates  bids  based  on  price, 
procurement  objectives  and  priorities;  identifies  the  winning  bids;  prepares  a 
recommendation for the Commission. The Procurement Monitor observes the bidding and 
evaluation process and makes its own recommendation.219  
•  Commission decision – After review of the Procurement Administrator’s and Procurement 
Monitor’s reports and recommendations, the Commission renders a decision on the results 
of the procurement event.220 
•  Release of procurement results – The Procurement Administrator releases the results of the 
procurement event; confidential information is protected.221 
•  Contract execution with the utilities – Within three business days of Commission approval of 
the procurement results, utilities and winning bidders sign binding contractual arrangements 
using the standard form contracts.222 
As Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(vi) of the Act continues to require that competitive procurements “shall 
follow the procurement processes and procedures described in this Section and Section 16-111.5 of 
the Public Utilities Act to the extent practicable,” the competitive procurements for RECs described 
in the 2022 Long-Term Plan will continue to follow this approach where not modified by new 
requirements of Illinois law.

As  these  procurements  were  conducted  prior  to  modifications  in  P.A.  99-0906  providing  for 
centralized budgeting, planning, and procurements conducted by the IPA to serve all retail customer 
load, these procurements were generally only funded through either eligible retail customers 
(default supply customers) or the State of Illinois.  Some of these procurements, especially the 
LTPPAs, still provide RECs that are used to help meet Section 1-75(c)(1)(B)’s RPS goals, although 
RECs from systems energized prior to June 1, 2017 cannot be utilized to meet Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)’s 
targets for the procurement of RECs from new projects.  
5.2.2.    Procurements Conducted After P.A. 99-0906  
With the enactment of Public Act 99-0906, the Agency began conducting procurements to meet RPS 
requirements applicable to all retail customer sales.  The first such procurements were the Initial 
Forward Procurements, conducted prior to the finalization of the Initial Plan.224  After the Initial 
Plan’s approval, the Agency conducted a series of procurements conducted under the Commission’s 
authority granted through its Order approving that Plan in Docket No. 17-0838.  Those procurements 
are listed below:   
•  2017 and 2018 Initial Forward Procurements (15 year contracts for new utility-scale wind 
and new utility-scale solar, 965,000 Wind RECs and 1,000,000 Solar RECs per year procured)  
•  October 2018 First Subsequent Forward Procurement (15 year contracts for new utility-scale 
wind, 1,979,753 RECs procured) 
•  November 2018 Photovoltaic Forward Procurement (15 year contracts for new utility-scale 
solar, 2,000,000 RECs) 
•  July 2019 Brownfield Site Forward Procurement (15 year contracts, quantity not released 
due to only two projects selected)  
•  Second Subsequent Forward Procurement (15-year contracts for new utility-scale wind). 
Two procurement events, conducted October 2019 and March 2021, No bids were accepted 
in either procurement;  
•  Community Renewable Generation Procurement (15-year contracts for non-PV renewable 
technologies). No bids were accepted; 
•  Low-income Community Solar Pilot Project Procurement (15-year contracts; conducted 
pursuant to Section 1-56(b)(2)(D) of the Act)   
The original Brownfield Site Forward Procurement was conducted in the fall of 2018 and did not 
feature any winning projects. In February of 2019, the Agency sought feedback225 from stakeholders 
and then petitioned the Commission to reopen Docket No. 17-0838 seeking clarification for the 
authority to reconduct the procurement with certain modifications.  Following the Commission’s 
approval of that request, the second Brownfield Site Forward Procurement was then conducted in 
spring/early summer 2019 with the Commission approving the results on August 1, 2019. While the 
specific quantity procurement in the brownfield site procurement was not disclosed given that only 
two bidders were successful,226 the procurement did exceed the then-applicable statutory target of 
 
224 See 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(G)(i), (ii).

226 By releasing quantity information in a procurement with two winning bidders, each bidder would be able to determine the quantity of 
the other’s selected bid, and thus determine that other bidder’s bid price.

40,000 RECs annually by the 2020-2021 delivery year (although such RECs could begin being 
delivered after that date under the procurement’s contracts) but did not meet the then-applicable 
60,000 REC procurement target for the 2025-26 delivery year. 
The Second Subsequent Forward Procurement (new utility-scale wind), Community Renewable 
Generation Forward Procurement (non-photovoltaic), and the Low-income Community Solar Pilot 
Project Procurement (part of Illinois Solar for All) were all conducted in the Fall of 2019. Both the 
Second Subsequent Forward Procurement and the Community Renewable Generation Forward 
Procurement227 did not produce any winning bids.  Consistent with the Commission’s Order in Docket 
No. 19-0995,228 the Agency conducted an additional procurement event for RECs from new utility-
scale wind projects in the Spring of 2021; however, no bids were selected.229   
Based on challenges outlined in comments received after the conclusion of unsuccessful new utility-
scale wind procurement events – namely, the inability to obtain a bundled REC and energy contract 
through the IPA, the paucity of long-term energy-only off-takers for geographically-qualifying new 
utility-scale wind and solar projects, and the risks inherent with fixed price REC revenues against 
potentially volatile wholesale energy market prices – the Agency is hopeful that many of these 
challenges have been addressed through the shift to an Indexed REC price contract structure.230  
Further discussion of that structure is found in Section 5.7 below.   
The table below provides an outline of those competitive procurements conducted between the 
enactment of Public Act 99-0906 and Public Act 102-0662. This includes both the statutorily required 
Initial Forward Procurements which were conducted prior to the approval of the Initial Long-Term 
Plan as well as procurements authorized in Long-Term Plans:

renewable generation projects.

5.3. Statutory Requirements 
Requirements applicable to competitive procurements conducted by the IPA can be found in Section 
16-111.5 of the PUA and Section 1-75 of the IPA Act.  Requirements applicable to this Plan’s content 
are generally included in the PUA; those are outlined below.    
Section 16-111.5(b)(5)(ii)(B)(aa) of the PUA requires that this Plan: 
“Identify the procurement programs and competitive procurement events consistent 
with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Power Agency Act and shall be designed 
to achieve the goals set forth in subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of that Act.”  
The “competitive procurement events” contemplated by the IPA are discussed in this Chapter, while 
the “procurement programs” are discussed in Chapters 7 and 8. Also specifically addressed in this 
chapter is the following additional provision (bb) of that subsection of the Act regarding REC 
procurements subsequent to the Initial Forward Procurement: 
“Include a schedule for procurements for renewable energy credits from utility-scale 
wind projects, utility-scale solar projects, and brownfield site photovoltaic projects 
consistent with subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of 
the Illinois Power Agency Act.” 
Section 16-111.5(b)(5)(iii) further states that,  
“For those renewable energy credits subject to procurement through a competitive bid 
process under the plan or under the initial forward procurements for wind and solar 
resources described in subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 
1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, the Agency shall follow the procurement process 
specified in the provisions relating to electricity procurement in subsections (e) through 
(i) of this Section.”  
In addition, Section 16-111.5(e)-(i) includes requirements applicable to competitive procurement 
events, many of which are outlined in Section 5.1 above.  Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(vi) incorporates those 
requirements into competitive REC procurement events “to the extent practicable.”  The Agency has 
generally found those requirements practicable to include, although new changes to Section 1-
75(c)(1)(G)(v), 1-75(c)(1)(P), and 1-75(c-10) of the IPA Act may require additional deviation from 
Section 16-111.5’s procurement process.  Additional discussion of changes to the competitive 
procurement structure necessitated by these changes in law can be found below.       
The Agency has achieved generally positive results in past experience with this competitive bid 
process.  REC delivery prices have proven competitive, thus reducing the budget impact of supporting 
new project development, and most procurements have resulted in targeted procurement quantities 
being met.  However, the attrition rate for projects awarded REC delivery contracts through 
competitive procurements has been suboptimal—at the time of the Plan’s filing, in the range of 20-
25% attrition, as compared to attrition of less than 10% across all ABP categories.  The Agency is 
hopeful that additional changes found in P.A. 102-0662 will reduce that attrition rate further by 
reducing development risk and ensure that prices remain low by reducing risk premiums build into 
bids,  while also  achieving  important  qualitative  objectives  by  supporting  a  diverse,  inclusive, 
equitable, and fairly compensated workforce.

5.4. New Requirements under P.A. 102-0662 
The increased RPS goals, procurement targets, and funding associated with Public Act 102-0662 will 
expand the Agency’s procurement of RECs from new utility-scale wind, new utility-scale solar, and 
new brownfield-site photovoltaic projects.  The new targets include 10 million RECs from new solar 
and wind projects delivered annually by the end of the 2021 delivery year and increasing ratably to 
reach 45 million RECs delivered annually from new wind and new solar projects by the end of the 
2030 delivery year.237  
Of that amount, 45% is targeted to be met through RECs from new wind projects, while 55% is 
targeted to be met through RECs from new photovoltaic projects. Then, of that amount to be procured 
from new photovoltaic projects, 50% is to be procured through the Adjustable Block Program, 47% 
from utility-scale solar projects, and 3% has to come from brownfield site photovoltaic projects.238  
This leaves a 2021 delivery year utility-scale target of at least 2.585 million RECs delivered annually 
from new utility-scale solar projects,239 at least 141,000 RECs from new brownfield site photovoltaic 
projects,240 and at least 4.5 million RECs from new utility-scale wind projects.241  RECs under contract 
from  facilities  qualifying  as  “new”  (such  as  those  from  post-P.A.  99-0906  programs  and 
procurements) may be used to meet this 2021 10 million REC target and the 45 million REC 2030 
target, but not considered for purposes of determining whether the correct proportions of RECs have 
been procured.      
Section  1-75(c)(1)(G)(iii)  directs  the  Agency  to  conduct  “at  least  one  subsequent  forward 
procurement for renewable energy credits from new utility-scale wind projects, new utility-scale 
solar projects, and new brownfield site photovoltaic projects within 240 days after the effective date” 
of P.A. 102-0662 in an attempt to meet this 10 million REC target.  This procurement occurred in May 
2022, well before this Plan was scheduled to be approved by the ICC. To meet the 10 million REC 
target, the Agency developed the following annual procurement quantity targets (expressed in 
annual delivery quantities) for its subsequent forward procurement. 
Table 5-2: Spring 2022 Subsequent Forward Procurement Target Volumes 
Utility-scale Wind    2,500,000 RECs 
Utility-scale Solar    2,000,000 RECs 
Brownfield Site Photovoltaic    125,000 RECs242 
The total target quantity of annual REC deliveries for this subsequent forward procurement was 
4,625,000 RECs.  Combined with RECs expected from the December 2021 block reopening of the 
Adjustable Block Program (approximately 1 million RECs) and previously procured new utility-scale 
wind and new utility-scale photovoltaic RECs and new brownfield site photovoltaic RECs (see Table 
5-3),  this  subsequent  forward  procurement’s  target  quantities  would  result  in  Section  1-
 
237 20 ILCS 3855/1-75 (c) (1) (C)(i) 
238 Id. 
239 47% of 55% of 10 million.   
240 3% of 55% of 10 million.   
241 45% of 10 million.   
242 Combined with the approximately 970,000 RECs expected through Adjustable Block Program reopening, REC procurement activities 
authorized prior to this Plan’s approval feature target quantities for new photovoltaic REC procurement (3.095 million) versus new wind 
REC procurement (2.5 million) at a ratio of 1.238:1.  The IPA believes this ratio is acceptably close to the 55% to 45% proportion between 
new photovoltaic project REC procurement and new wind project REC procurement found in Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) (1.222:1).

75(c)(1)(C)’s 10 million REC annual delivery target being exceeded by RECs under contract prior to 
any additional program and procurement activity authorized by this Plan. 
Actual  results  from  the  subsequent  forward  procurement  were  significantly  less  than  target 
quantities.  While actual contracted REC delivery quantities from individual projects were not 
released (in an effort to protect the confidentiality of individual bid prices), the subsequent forward 
procurement resulted in approximately 495 MW of new utility-scale solar, 200 MW of new utility-
scale wind, and 4.95 MW of new brownfield site photovoltaic projects.243   
While RECs procured through Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iii)’s subsequent forward procurement will be 
included  in  planned  quantities  of  RECs  under  contract,  this  Plan  focuses  on  competitive 
procurements to be conducted during the 2022 and 2023 delivery years.  Additionally, as the target 
procurement quantities derived through Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) of the Act are minimums and are now 
accompanied by new text stating that “if forecasted expenses are less than the maximum budget 
available . . . the Agency shall continue to procure new renewable energy credits until that budget is 
exhausted,” 244 procurement quantities may not mirror statutory target minimums.  
5.4.1  RPS Budgets   
As described in Chapter 3, the Agency’s procurement of RECs is subject to budgetary limitations 
determined by Section 1-75(c)(1)(E)’s rate impact cap.  That cap that limits the annual average net 
increase paid per kilowatthour by eligible customers, thus providing a maximum RPS budget once 
multiplied by the prior year’s retail electricity sales.   
In previous REC procurements, budget limits served to limit the quantity of RECs that could be 
procured through competitive procurements such that actual RECs under contract fell well short of 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(B)’s RPS goals.  However, increased funding for REC procurements brought about 
by PA 102-0662, including the increase in the rate cap from 2.015% of 2007 rates to 4.25% of 2009 
rates as well as Section 16-108(k) of the PUA’s accounting provisions that allow funds to be used over 
longer time periods and shield funding associated with contractual obligations from reconciliation, 
have dramatically impacted the RPS budgets allowing for expanded procurements of RECs from new 
utility-scale wind and new utility-scale solar projects.  However, actual budget impacts resulting from 
competitive procurements are now subject to increased volatility given the Indexed REC approach 
now authorized under Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(v).  Nevertheless, the IPA does not believe that RPS 
budgets should serve to constrain procurement quantities below statutory procurement targets for 
the present planning period.   
RPS budgets are discussed in further detail in Chapter 3.   
5.4.2  Brownfield Site Photovoltaic Project Procurements 
P.A. 102-0662 increases the goals for the procurement of RECs from photovoltaic projects located at 
brownfield sites—both by increasing the minimum amount (from 2% of the solar procurement target 
to 3%) and by that overall solar target increasing (now 55% of 45 million RECs by 2030).

116,124,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Under the definition contained in Section 1-10 of the IPA Act, brownfield sites are those sites which 
are regulated under the U.S. EPA’s Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and 
Liability Act of 1980; the Corrective Action Program of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; 
the Illinois EPA’s Illinois Site Remediation Program; or the Illinois EPA’s Illinois Solid Waste Program; 
or is the site of a former coal mine that has met all state and federal remediation and clean-up 
requirements.  This allowance for siting a brownfield site photovoltaic project at a former coal mine 
is a new change enacted through P.A. 102-0662.   
To  meet  these  more  aggressive  targets  under  this  more  permissive  definition,  Section  1-
75(c)(1)(C)(i) of the Act now specifies that the Agency shall “consider other approaches, in addition 
to competitive procurements, that can be used to procure renewable energy credits from brownfield 
site photovoltaic projects and thereby help return blighted or contaminated land to productive use 
while  enhancing  public  health  and  the  well-being  of  Illinois  residents,  including  those  in 
environmental justice communities.”  For this 2022 Plan, the Agency proposes to conduct two 
brownfield site photovoltaic procurements using its traditional competitive procurement approach.  
However, as that approach will reflect the changes to REC pricing and procurement processes found 
elsewhere in P.A. 102-0662 (including the utilization of an Indexed REC price), the Agency will first 
observe the results of procurements using this new structure and before assessing whether other 
procurement approaches may be warranted.  That assessment will be included in the Agency’s next 
Long-Term Plan revision scheduled to be published in 2023 and approved by the ICC in 2024.   
5.4.3  Labor, Diversity and Equity Requirements 
New labor, diversity and equity provisions in the Act require the Agency to take measures that will 
incorporate these provisions into its competitive procurement process.   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q)(1) of the IPA Act now provides that all new utility-scale wind, utility-scale solar 
and brownfield site photovoltaic projects are subject to prevailing wage requirements included in 
the Prevailing Wage Act, and that RECs procured after the effective date of the Act (September 15, 
2021) must be from facilities that were built under a project labor agreement.23 Projects participating 
in  competitive  procurements  will  be  required  to  provide  documentation  that  all  employees, 
contractors, and subcontractors engaged in construction and maintenance of the facility received at 
least the local prevailing wage as set by the Illinois Department of Labor.  Furthermore, as a result of 
P.A. 102-0662 and clarifications made through P.A. 102-0673, all new utility-scale wind, utility scale 
solar, and brownfield site photovoltaic projects participating in a competitive procurement of the IPA 
are considered ""public works” under the Prevailing Wage Act and are thus subject to all notice and 
reporting requirements therein. Bids must include commitments to include payment of prevailing 
wage in all contracts and subcontracts for construction and maintenance related to the facility. All 
accepted bidders will be subject to reporting requirements throughout the life of the project as 
detailed in the Prevailing Wage Act.  
As outlined in Chapter 4, projects located in adjacent states satisfying public interest criteria scoring 
may be eligible for the IPA’s competitive procurements.  As proposed by the IPA in Docket No. 22-
0231 and affirmed by the Commission in its Order approving the Plan,245 Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q)(1) 
also carries a qualitative eligibility requirement related to fair wages paid for labor on all renewable 
energy projects bidding into IPA procurements (enforced as a REC delivery contract term).  Applicant

projects located in adjacent states must demonstrate, at minimum, wage parity with the prevailing 
wage requirements in Illinois.   
To achieve wage parity, if the project is located in a county in an adjacent state with published 
prevailing wages, that wage schedule shall be used as the applicable prevailing wage for Section 1-
75(c)(1)(Q)(1) compliance.  Should there be no governing prevailing wage schedule for that locality, 
the  federal  Davis-Bacon  rates  shall  be  used  as  the  applicable  prevailing  wage  for  Section  1-
75(c)(1)(Q)(1) compliance.246   
In addition, Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q)(2) also provides that for REC procurements from new utility-scale 
wind, utility-scale solar, and brownfield site photovoltaic projects, such projects must be “built by 
general contractors that must enter into a project labor agreement,” as defined by the Project Labor 
Agreements Act, “prior to construction.”  Section 1-10 of the Act defines a project labor agreement as 
“a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement that covers all terms and conditions of employment on a 
specific construction project.”   
That project labor agreement must be filed with the Director of the IPA within 60 days prior to the 
start of construction.  If construction of the project has already begun at the time of a competitive 
procurement then the project labor agreement must be filed with the IPA prior to submitting a bid.   
Under Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q)(2), the project labor agreement must provide “the names, addresses, 
and occupations of the owner of the plant and the individuals representing the labor organization 
employees  participating  in  the  project  labor  agreement  consistent  with  the  Project  Labor 
Agreements Act.”  Section 1-10 outlines specific additional elements required to be included in that 
agreement:  
(1) provisions establishing the minimum hourly wage for each class of labor organization 
employee; 
(2) provisions establishing the benefits and other compensation for each class of labor 
organization employee; 
(3) provisions establishing that no strike or disputes will be engaged in by the labor 
organization employees; 
(4) provisions establishing that no lockout or disputes will be engaged in by the general 
contractor building the project; and 
(5) provisions for minorities and women, as defined under the Business Enterprise for 
Minorities, Women, and Persons with Disabilities Act, setting forth goals for apprenticeship 
hours to be performed by minorities and women and setting forth goals for total hours to 
be performed by underrepresented minorities and women.    
As a project labor agreement is a private agreement between a project developer and a labor 
organization entered into with both parties’ acquiescence, and as the IPA Act does not direct the 
Agency to develop qualitative project labor agreement standards, the Agency does not believe that it 
can or should generally develop minimum project labor agreement terms for that agreement to 
 
246 For adjacent state projects, the applicant is still responsible for submitting a Certified Transcript of Payroll through the Illinois 
Department of Labor Prevailing Wage portal and to the IPA for all work performed on the eligible project.  The IPA is responsible for 
ensuring wage parity compliance under REC delivery contract authority, with projects failing to demonstrate wage parity treated 
equivalently to Illinois-based projects failing to comply with the prevailing wage requirements of the Prevailing Wage Act.

satisfy Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q)(2)’s requirements.  However, a labor organization and the general 
contractor building the project shall have the authority to include other terms and conditions as they 
deem necessary.   
One possible exception regarding developing minimum project labor agreement terms concerns 
“provisions for minorities and women, as defined under the Business Enterprise for Minorities, 
Women, and Persons with Disabilities Act, setting forth goals for apprenticeship hours to be 
performed by minorities and women and setting forth goals for total hours to be performed by 
underrepresented minorities and women.”247    
As proposed by the IPA in Docket No. 22-0231 and affirmed by the Commission in approving the Plan, 
project labor agreement submittals must also include a description of the efforts the entity will take 
or  has  taken  to  achieve  such  goals,  including  recruitment  of  minorities  and  women  into 
apprenticeship roles.  Setting goals is an important step toward progress, but without the ability to 
review  whether  robust  efforts  are  being  made  to  recruit  more  minorities  and  women  into 
apprenticeships or training programs, the Agency has no insight into industry trends, challenges in 
meeting those goals, or other important signals related to the Agency’s expanded role in monitoring 
and improving equity in the clean energy sector.248 
Other amendments to the IPA Act through Public Act 102-0662 create obligations for the Agency to 
“encourage participating projects to use a diverse and equitable workforce and a diverse set of 
contractors.” Under new subparagraph (P) of Section 1-75(c)(1), the Agency must optimize the 
procurement of RECs from utility-scale projects located in communities eligible to receive Energy 
Transition Community Grants. To “optimize” procurement from those areas, the Agency proposes 
that bids received through competitive procurements for proposed projects located in Energy 
Transition Community Grant communities would receive a downward price adjustment of 10% of 
the lowest bid received for use in ranking bids received, thus making those bids more competitive on 
the basis of price.  For example, if the bidder of a project located in an Energy Transition Community 
Grant community submits a strike price of $65 and the lowest bid received is $50, then the Energy 
Transition Community Grant bidder would receive a downward price adjustment in its bid of $5 
(10% of $50). The price adjusted bid of $60 would be evaluated against all other bids, and if selected 
the Energy Transition Community Grant bidder would receive the initial bid price of $65.  This price 
adjustment  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  “optimize”  the  procurement  of  Energy  Transition 
Community Grants through a competitive process.   
Section 1-75(c-10)(3) directs the Agency to develop requirements for applications and include in its 
bid evaluation methodology preferences for bidders that utilize a higher percentage of equity eligible 
contractors. The Agency will require applications from bidders to demonstrate compliance with the 
minimum equity standards  under Section 1-75(c-10) (described in more detail in Chapter 10).  Based 
on a review of the plan submitted by a bidder, the Agency would then identify bids that demonstrate 
comprehensive compliance above and beyond minimum requirements and propose a bid evaluation 
price adjustment that increases as the portion of contract value flowing to equity eligible persons or 
contractors increases above the minimum equity standards.  This bid evaluation price adjustment 
would be on a sliding scale based on the equity eligible commitment above the 10% minimum 
requirement.  For example, if a bidder commits to using equity eligible contractors for 50% of the 
 
247 20 ILCS 3855/1-10.

project’s development, then the price adjustment would be based on the ratio of 50% to the 10% 
minimum (or 5 times the amount of the minimum equity commitment).   
The IPA is proposing a bid evaluation price adjustment for equity eligible commitments above 10% 
to be 1% of the lowest bid received times that ratio of the commitment to the 10% minimum.  Like 
the adjustment for projects located in Energy Transition Community Grant areas, this adjustment 
would  only  be  utilized  for  bid  evaluation,  not  the  resulting  contracted  strike  price.  As  this 
commitment would impact bid selection, any project selected as a result of making an equity 
commitment will have that commitment included as a binding commitment in the resulting REC 
contract.  
Table 5-3 demonstrates the bid evaluation price adjustments for equity eligible commitments and 
Energy Transition Community Grant bids.  As discussed in Chapter 10 of this Plan, entities awarded 
a REC contract through a competitive procurement will also be required to submit a Compliance Plan 
within 30 days of ICC approval of the bid.  The Compliance Plan shall reflect the entity’s plan to meet 
the minimum equity standard as laid out in their application. Chapter 10 contains additional 
information on compliance plan requirements.

5.4.4  Indexed REC Pricing Requirements 
Perhaps the most significant change to competitive procurements resultant from P.A. 102-0662 is 
the shift to an Indexed REC pricing structure.  Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(v) now requires the Agency to 
procure “Indexed RECs” for all future competitive REC procurements.  Under an Indexed REC pricing 
structure, the actual REC price is determined based on the strike price submitted by bidders 
participating in the procurement (with that strike price used for bid selection), as outlined further 
below.249 
Under Section 1-10 of the IPA Act, an Indexed REC is defined “as a tradable credit that represents the 
environmental attributes of one megawatt hour of energy produced from a renewable energy 
resource, the price of which shall be calculated by subtracting the Strike Price offered by a new utility-
scale wind project or a new utility-scale photovoltaic project from the Index Price in a given  
settlement period.”250  The Strike Price is defined as the “contract price for energy and RECs from a 
new utility-scale wind project   or a new utility-scale photovoltaic project.”  The Index Price is defined 
as the “real-time energy settlement price  at the applicable Illinois trading hub, such as PJM-NIHUB or 
MISO-IL, for a given settlement period.”251  The settlement period will be the period of time utilized by 
MISO and PJM and their successor organizations as the basis for settlement calculations in the 
real-time energy market (RTM).252  
Under this model, the IPA still may evaluate competing bids on the basis of price—but on the basis 
of submitted Strike Price, rather than REC price.  A single Strike Price is submitted by a bidder, and 
the resulting REC price for a settlement period is determined across the course of the contract as the 
difference between that bidder’s Strike Price and the Index Price.  As the Index Price will always be 
the same for all bidders, evaluating bids from lowest to highest on the basis of Strike Price is 
effectively the same evaluation as evaluating bids on the bases of REC price; the difference is simply 
that because the resulting REC price floats, the exact price (and resulting RPS budget impact) varies 
by settlement period.   
From a bidder’s standpoint, this Indexed REC approach offers clear advantages.  Given the limited 
market for energy-alone off-take agreements in Illinois and the inability for the IPA to offer bundled 
PPAs, an Indexed REC price structure offers bidders the revenue certainty of a bundled contract 
without exposing default supply rates to potentially uneconomic hedges.  From the standpoint of 
developing the most possible renewable energy at the lowest possible cost, this approach offers 
advantages back to the State of Illinois as well; if bidders receive full revenue certainty at the strike 
price amount, then risk premiums build into bids should be minimized, allowing for the development 
of more renewable energy generation at the lowest possible RPS budget impact.   
As required under Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(v)(3) of the Act, contracts must have a “minimum tenure of 
20 calendar years”.   
5.4.5  Indexed REC Settlement 
An Indexed REC Price will be calculated for each settlement period. The REC price applicable to a 
settlement period will be determined by subtracting the Strike Price from the Index Price for that

settlement period.  As required under Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(v)(1), if the difference is a negative 
number, the indexed REC counterparty (i.e., the public utility) shall owe the seller the absolute value 
multiplied by the quantity of energy produced during that settlement period.  If this difference results in 
a positive number, the seller shall owe the indexed  REC counterparty this amount multiplied by the 
quantity of energy produced in the relevant settlement period.  The Indexed REC Price formula is 
illustrated below 
Indexed REC Price  =  Index Price (RTM Settlement Price) – Strike Price (Contract Price) 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(v)(2) requires that “[p]arties shall cash settle every month, summing up all 
settlements (both positive and negative, if applicable) for the prior month.”  Based on comments the 
IPA has received on the REC settlement process, the Plan proposes an hourly settlement structure 
for each monthly settlement period.      
The example below illustrates a monthly settlement for 2 scenarios—one in which money is owed 
to the seller, and the other in which money is owed to the Indexed REC Counterparty. 
 
Scenario 1 – Cash Settlement to Seller 
Index Price  =  $30/MWh 
Strike Price  =  $35/MWh 
Energy Generated  =  100 MWh 
Indexed REC Price  =  30 – 35     =  -$5/MWh 
Money owed to Seller  =  ‖-5‖ x 100    =  $500  
Scenario 2 – Cash Settlement to Indexed REC Counterparty 
Index Price  =  $40MWh 
Strike Price  =  $35/MWh 
Energy Generated  =  100 MWh 
Indexed REC Price  =  40 – 35   =  $5/MWh 
Money owed to Indexed REC Counterparty  =  5 x 100   =  $500 
 
In Scenario 1, the difference between the Index Price and the Strike Price (i.e., the Indexed REC Price) 
is negative (-$5/MWh) and so the absolute value of the Indexed REC Price is multiplied by the 
quantity of energy produced in the relevant settlement period (100 MWh), and the resulting amount 
($500) is paid to the seller.  In Scenario 2, the Indexed REC Price is positive ($5/MWh), and the 
resulting amount ($500) is paid to the Indexed REC Counterparty. 
5.4.6  Forward Price Curve 
To ensure funding in the annual budget for Indexed REC procurements for each year of the term of such 
contracts, the Act requires that the annual cost of the contract be quantified utilizing an industry-
standard, third-party forward price curve for energy at the appropriate hub or load zone.253 
The Agency will review the forward price curves that are available from third-party providers and 
select the price curve source that will be used in the annual cost calculations.  Each forward price 
curve will contain a specific value of the forecasted market price of electricity for each annual delivery 
year of the contract.  For procurement planning purposes, the impact on the annual budget for the 
 
253 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(G)(v)(3).

 ",5. Competitive Procurements  ,[],640,12,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
122,130,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
cost of Indexed RECs for each delivery year will be determined as the expected annual contract 
expenditure for that year, equaling the difference between (i) the sum across all relevant contracts 
of the applicable strike price multiplied by the contract quantity and (ii) the sum across all relevant 
contracts of the forward price curve for the applicable load zone for that year multiplied by the 
contract quantity.   
Given that the indexed price of electricity during the delivery year will not likely average to the 
forecasted market price of electricity for the delivery year, this calculation is simply for budget 
planning purposes only, and is not meant to establish an annual cost cap for utility REC purchases.    
The Act requires that forward price curves be revised on an annual basis.  Updated forward price 
curves will be released and filed with the Commission in the proceeding approving the Agency's most 
recent long-term renewable resources procurement plan, and the Agency’s next long-term plan filing 
will utilize a forward price curve in estimating Indexed REC contract budget impacts.254  If the 
expected contract spend is higher or lower than the total quantity of contracts multiplied by the 
forward price curve value for that year, the forward price curve will   be updated using then-currently 
available price forecast data, and the RPS budget projections will be adjusted accordingly. 
5.4.7  Application of the Price Curve 
To  manage  future  budget  obligations  resulting  from  competitive  procurements,  Section  1-
75(c)(1)(G)(v)(4) states that the Agency may consider the institution of a price collar on REC prices 
paid under indexed renewable energy credit procurements establishing floor and ceiling REC prices 
applicable  to  indexed  REC  contract  prices.    Any  price  collars  utilized  in  competitive  REC 
procurements  “shall  be  proposed  by  the  Agency  through  its  long-term  renewable  resources 
procurement plan.”   
While the Agency appreciates how a price collar may offer slightly better budget stability, after 
consideration of the increase in the annual RPS funds collections combined with the changes to 
Section 16-108(k) of the Public Utilities Act that allow for the use of RPS funds over a five year period, 
as well as the ability to exempt from reconciliation payment obligations entered into, but not yet paid, 
the Agency does not believe that a price collar is necessary for upcoming competitive procurements 
as the Agency has these additional tools to manage year to year budget fluctuations.   
5.5. Proposed Procurement Events 
An assessment of what needs to be procured to meet these targets starts with an assessment of RECs 
under  contract,  and  specifically  RECs  under  contract  to  meet  utility-scale  wind  and  solar 
procurement requirements from prior procurement events.   
Across competitive procurement events conducted to date, some projects have been developed, 
other projects are pending final energization still, while others appear to never be successfully 
developed under REC delivery contacts (and thus would not be contributing RECs to meet RPS 
targets).  While four utility-scale wind projects and six utility-scale solar projects have begun 
delivery, other projects have not yet been energized. Five solar projects have requested energization 
extensions that will take them into 2022-2023 delivery year, and four solar projects and two wind 
projects have been removed from the REC portfolio.

Table 5-3 summarizes in aggregate the status of utility-scale projects as of March 21, 2022. The 
quantities listed are the aggregated contracted amounts by expected annual REC deliveries.  For 
planning purposes, the IPA assumes that projects for which extensions have been granted will be 
successfully developed.

As  a  consequence,  additional  procurement  events  will  be  required  to  ensure  that  Section  1-
75(c)(1)(C)’s new renewable energy project delivery targets are met.   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) sets an initial REC procurement target for the 2021 delivery year of 10 million 
RECs, the bulk of which will be procured from new utility-scale wind, new utility-scale solar projects, 
and brownfield site photovoltaic projects in a Subsequent Forward Procurement scheduled for the 
Spring of 2022, prior to the approval of this 2022 Long-Term Plan.  That target grows to 45 million 
RECs by 2030.   
For purposes of this Plan, the Agency will assume that procurement quantities outlined for that 
procurement (as listed in Table 5-2 above) will be met, but reserves the right to adjust proposed 
competitive procurement quantities for future procurement events (potentially while this Plan is 
pending before the ICC) based on observed results from that Subsequent Forward Procurement.    
5.5.1.  Utility-Scale Solar and Utility-Scale Wind 
As outlined above, across 2017-2019, the Agency conducted a series of forward procurement events 
intended to support the development of new utility-scale wind and utility-scale solar projects.  
Through these procurement events, approximately 3 million annual deliveries of RECs each of utility-
scale wind and utility-scale solar were placed under contract.  As outlined in tables above, after 
project attrition, the IPA expects approximately 2.5 million utility-scale solar RECs and 2 million 
utility-scale wind RECs to be delivered annually as a result of these procurement events.   
While wind constitutes 45% of the “45 million by 2030” new build target found in Section 1-
75(c)(1)(C) of the RPS, utility-scale wind appears to be the only viable means for cost-effectively 
developing new wind projects.  As a consequence, while photovoltaics may be a larger (55%) portion 
of the whole, because only 47% of that photovoltaic target is to come from utility-scale solar projects, 
utility-scale solar constitutes a lower proportion of the minimum RPS quantities than utility-scale 
wind.   
Minimums are not maximums, however, and as the statute a) uses “at least” in referring to those 
targets and b) sets up proportions within the solar percentage as proportions of a minimum amount, 
 
255 “Removed” indicates RECs that were procured in the 2017 and 2018 procurements but will not be delivered because of the projects not 
meeting energization deadlines and thus have been removed from the RPS REC Portfolio.

the IPA believes that it can exceed necessary minimums for utility-scale solar RECs if so warranted.  
Should the Subsequent Forward Procurement prove successful at facilitating new utility-scale solar 
development, then that will indeed be the case.   Nevertheless, the Agency has outlined procurement 
targets for new utility-scale wind projects that outpace those from new utility-scale solar targets 
given these larger utility-scale wind targets.   
5.5.2.  Brownfield Site Photovoltaic 
In the Initial Plan, the Agency proposed a procurement for RECs from brownfield site photovoltaic 
projects with a target of 80,000 RECs delivered annually. The procurement was initially held in the 
fall of 2018 in conjunction with the Photovoltaic Forward Procurement and did not successfully 
procure any RECs. The Agency subsequently issued a request for comments from stakeholders to 
better understand barriers to a successful procurement and filed a motion for clarification with the 
ICC seeking authorization to conduct a second procurement. The Commission granted that motion 
on April 26, 2019.  
The Agency made certain adjustments to the procurement guidelines (notably around acceptable age 
of documentation of eligibility) and conducted another procurement on July 26, 2019. On August 1, 
2019, the Commission approved the results, which resulted in exceeding the at-that-time statutory 
target of 40,000 RECs delivered annually by 2020-2021.  
The IPA intends to use a price-based competitive approach for the procurement of brownfield site 
photovoltaic RECs conducted pursuant to this Plan.  While Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) requires that the 
Agency “consider other approaches, in addition to competitive procurements, that can be used to 
procure renewable energy credits from brownfield site photovoltaic projects,”256 proposing an 
alternative approach now may be premature.  The Agency expects that the use of Indexed REC pricing 
and a more expansive definition of brownfield site photovoltaic projects will address the problem of 
unmet targets.  If these changes do not address the barriers affecting brownfield site photovoltaic 
REC procurements, the Agency will determine whether an alternative procurement approach should 
be implemented as part of its next Plan.   
Under this 2022 Plan, the Agency proposes to conduct one brownfield site photovoltaic procurement 
annually for the next two years, at quantities intended to keep pace with 2030 brownfield site 
photovoltaic target.  
5.5.3.  Non-Photovoltaic Community Renewable Generation 
In the Initial Plan, the Agency proposed a Community Renewable Generation Program Forward 
Procurement (see Section 5.8.4 of the Initial Plan). This Community Renewable Generation Program 
Forward  Procurement  was  intended  create  an  opportunity  for  non-photovoltaic  community 
generation projects to be developed.  That procurement was conducted in December 2019 and did 
not yield any selected bids.  In Docket No. 19-0995 approving the First Revised Plan, no party sought 
for an additional community renewable generation procurement to be conducted.   
Since that time, Section 1-75(c)(1)(N) of the IPA Act has been revised to no longer mandate a 
Community Renewable Generation Program.  In its present form, subparagraph (N) now states that, 
through this Plan, the Agency “may consider whether community renewable generation projects

utilizing technologies other than photovoltaics should be supported through State-administered 
incentive funding, and may issue requests for information to gauge market demand.”   
The Agency appreciates the potential opportunities for additional community renewable generation 
procurements to expand the range and diversity of renewable energy resources in Illinois, and notes 
that changes in maximum community renewable generation project size (from 2 MW to 5 MW) may 
warrant a formal Request for Information being issued between this Plan and the Agency’s next Plan 
developed across the Summer of 2023.   
5.5.4.  Procurement of RECs from Renewable Energy Resources other than 
New Wind and Solar 
The Agency is not proposing any procurements of RECs from resources other than new wind and 
new photovoltaic projects; this includes both other renewable energy generating technologies as well 
as procurements for RECs not from specific projects or intended to result in new project development 
(e.g., RECs from existing projects energized prior to June 1, 2017). 
As explained in Section 2.6.2.1, Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) of the IPA Act only established targets for RECs 
from new wind and furthermore that percentage-based RPS goals – be “met entirely by procurements 
of  renewable  energy  credits  from  new  wind  and  photovoltaic  projects.”    While  the  Agency 
appreciates that other renewable energy technologies are listed in the definition of renewable energy 
resources contained in Section 1-10 of the IPA Act, these provisions of Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)—taken 
in combination with the procurement priorities set forth in Section 1-75(c)(1)(F) of the Act—
preclude consideration of a procurement from technologies other than wind and solar.  RECs 
generated using technologies other than wind and solar can be used for other purposes, such as sales 
into voluntary REC markets outside the IPA’s purview, or by Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers for 
“green” or “renewable” retail electric supply offers. 
5.6. Proposed Schedule for Competitive Procurements 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) of the Act establishes a 2021 delivery year target of 10 million RECs delivered 
annually from new wind and solar projects.  That target increases ratably to 45 million RECs 
delivered annually from new wind and new solar projects by the end of the 2030 delivery year.  
The Agency understands the phrase “increasing ratably” to mean that the IPA should generally strive 
to procure an equal incremental amount of RECs each year, from 2022 to 2030, until the 2030 
delivery year target of 45 million RECs is met.  Based on RECs under contract and those targeted to 
be under contract (from the May 2022 competitive procurements and the December 2021 blocks 
from the Adjustable Block Program – which would total at least 10 million RECs delivered annually 
to meet the 2021 target, and the Agency will use 10 million RECs as the baseline quantity in 
determining a trajectory), the Agency would need to procure contracts for 3,888,889 RECs delivered 
annually each year starting in the 2022-2023 delivery year to meet that target.  Of that total, 72.5% 
would be required from competitive procurements, or 2,819,445 RECs delivered annually through 
each year’s new REC delivery contracts (with the remaining balance from the Adjustable Block 
Program).  Further informed by the proportion of RECs required within each category under Section 
1-75(c)(1)(C), this results in annual (rounded) procurement quantities of 1,750,000 utility-scale 
wind RECs, 1,000,000 utility-scale solar RECs, and 65,000 brownfield site photovoltaic RECs for each 
year’s competitive procurement events.

126,134,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)(ii) also requires that the if “if forecasted expenses are less than the maximum 
budget available under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (1), the Agency shall continue to procure 
new  renewable  energy  credits  until  that  budget  is  exhausted.”    In  the  case  of  competitive 
procurements for RECs from new utility-scale projects, however, “continuing to procure” is a more 
fraught  alternative:  contract  obligations  are  paid  upon  delivery,  meaning  that  procurement 
quantities now carry budget obligations 20+ years into the future and preclude additional program 
and procurement activity from being conducted.  Further, making too cavalier of an increase in 
competitive  procurement  event  quantities  may  reduce  the  competitiveness  of  individual 
procurement events, thus risking a negative impact on resulting prices (and resulting budget 
impacts).  Lastly, as the IPA has yet to observe results from the new Indexed REC price structure and 
how possible volatility from that structure risks future years’ budgets, it has elected to pursue more 
conservative procurement quantities.    
Therefore, in addition to the Subsequent Forward Procurement to be held in the Spring of 2022, the 
Agency is proposing to conduct the following competitive procurements during the 2022 and 2023 
calendar years at quantities developed to meet Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)’s statutory delivery year REC 
targets.  Targets may be adjusted upward based on results observed through the Subsequent 
Forward Procurement Event; as that procurement’s results will be known before the Commission’s 
approval  of  this  Plan,  the  IPA may  propose  those changes  during  the proceeding  before  the 
Commission seeking approval of this Plan.

With this 2022 Long-Term Plan being approved in July 2022, the Agency expects to conduct the 2022 
procurements  late  in  the  calendar  year  to  allow  for  time  to  implement  any  changes  to  the 
procurement requirements resulting from the approval of this plan.  For 2023, the Agency proposes 
to hold the procurement in late spring or early summer—and if procurement volumes are not filled, 
the IPA would consider holding a subsequent procurement in late 2023.  The Agency may request 
stakeholder feedback after a procurement event that does not meet it REC target to consider changes 
to the procurement requirements that could be made outside of updating this Long-Term Plan. 
5.6.1.  Proposed Schedule for Competitive Procurements 
This 2022 Long-Term Plan covers the Agency’s potential proposed procurements conducted during 
delivery years 2022 and 2023.  Procurements to be conducted after the 2023 delivery year will be 
considered in the next revised Plan.  A draft of that Plan is scheduled for release by mid-August 2023.

5.7. Contracts 
For the Initial Forward Procurements and additional competitive procurements conducted pursuant 
to the Initial Plan, the Agency updated its REC contract used in previous competitive procurements 
for renewable energy credits.  This update made changes to ensure that the contract was compliant 
with new requirements found in P.A. 99-0906, but otherwise followed the standard format of a Cover 
Sheet, Revisions to the Master REC Agreement, and the Master REC Agreement itself.    
Through the First Revised Plan, the Agency proposed significant revisions to the REC delivery 
contract structure utilized in competitive procurement events, including integrating what had been 
three separate sections of the contract into a single, more streamlined contract instrument. This 
revised contract was utilized in the March 2021 Subsequent Forward Procurement, and a version of 
it (otherwise updated for consistency with changes in law found in P.A. 102-0662) has also been 
utilized for the Subsequent Forward Procurement required under Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iii).   
5.7.1.  Credit Requirements 
To ensure that RECs under contract to satisfy a compliance requirement are indeed delivered, the 
Agency  proposes  to  continue  requiring  collateral  with  contracts,  with  the  collateral  amount 
established as a function of contract value.  While specific collateral levels are not proposed as part 
of  this  2022  Long-Term  Plan  (and  have  traditionally  been  determined  through  the  contract 
development process), the Agency believes that the level of collateral must be low enough to 
encourage participation (especially from small businesses and other newer market entrants) and 
high enough to discourage suppliers from voluntarily defaulting on contracts for economic reasons.   
As an initial step, to ensure that entities who participate in procurement events are committed to 
following  through  on  contract  performance,  the  IPA  proposes  a  strict  requirement  for  any 
procurements held pursuant to this 2022 Long-Term Plan that suppliers and associated facilities who 
voluntarily default on contracts for economic reasons (such as choosing to sell the RECs elsewhere 
after making the commitment to sell them to an Illinois utility) or misrepresent their eligibility to 
participate  in  a  procurement  event  will  risk  being  ineligible  for  participation  in  future  RPS 
procurements.    For  voluntary  economic  default,  an  initial  two-year  suspension  term  will  be 
considered to be a generally reasonable penalty, and the IPA has discretion to consider a harsher 
penalty  for  a  second  default  for  economic  reasons  or  if  it  finds  a  party  knowingly  made 
misrepresentations or acted in bad faith.257   
Thus, in determining whether precluding future participation is warranted, the Agency will review 
all available facts and evidence and consider whether the supplier or applicant made a good faith 
effort at compliance and whether non-compliance resulted from circumstances outside of that 
party’s control.  The Agency will monitor and review this requirement and will consider refinements 
or updates to it in future Plan revisions if necessary.  
 
257 See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 7-10.  In discussing “suppliers and associated facilities who voluntarily 
default on contracts for economic reasons,” the Agency is specifically referencing voluntary default on an Indexed REC contract because 
the developer elects to sell its RECs to another buyer under circumstances within that developer’s control—in particular, because of a 
more attractive REC price or contract structure offered by a different buyer.  Should default occur because of circumstances outside of that 
entity’s control—including the RPS budget being exceeded in a delivery year, unanticipated significant interconnection costs making 
development uneconomic, or other unforeseeable costs or circumstances sufficient to significantly alter project economics—then 
suspension would not be warranted.

Any forfeiture of collateral by a project under a competitively procured REC contract with a utility 
will be considered to be returned to the Renewable Resources Budget. 
5.8. Benchmarks 
Prior to the revisions to the RPS contained in Public Act 99-0906, benchmarks used for renewable 
energy  resources  procurements  (i.e.,  confidential  price  levels  above  which  no  bids  would  be 
accepted) were developed pursuant to a statutory provision requiring that the price paid for 
renewable energy resources being procured “not exceed benchmarks based on market prices for 
renewable energy resources in the region,” and required that such benchmarks “be developed by the 
procurement  administrator,  in  consultation  with  the  Commission  staff,  Agency  staff,  and  the 
procurement monitor” and “subject to Commission review and approval.”258  
As now modified through changes found in P.A. 102-0662, “cost-effective” means that the prices for 
RECs  
do not exceed benchmarks based on market prices for like products in the region. For 
purposes of this subsection (c), ""like products"" means contracts for renewable energy 
credits from the same or substantially similar technology, same or substantially similar 
vintage (new or existing), the same or substantially similar quantity, and the same or 
substantially  similar  contract  length  and  structure.  Benchmarks  shall  reflect 
development, financing, or related costs resulting from requirements imposed through 
other  provisions  of  State  law,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  requirements  in 
subparagraphs (P) and (Q) of this paragraph (1) and the Renewable Energy Facilities 
Agricultural Impact Mitigation Act.  Confidential benchmarks shall be developed by the 
procurement administrator, in consultation with the Commission staff, Agency staff, and 
the procurement monitor and shall be subject to Commission review and approval. If 
price benchmarks for like products in the region are not available, the procurement 
administrator shall establish price benchmarks based on publicly available data on 
regional technology costs and expected current and future regional energy prices.259 
Changes through P.A. 102-0662 serve to clarify that a) benchmarks are “confidential” (which is 
separately required under Section 16-111.5 of the PUA) and b) benchmarks developed shall reflect 
any costs imposed by “other provisions of State law” (which the Procurement Administrator would 
generally otherwise seek to do).   
Due  to  the  sensitive  nature  of  the  benchmark  development  process  and  how  the  release  of 
information related to the level of the benchmark could impact bidder behavior in competitive 
procurements, additional information will not be provided regarding the process for developing the 
benchmark or any range of potential benchmark prices. 
By law, these benchmarks are not to be used to curtail or otherwise reduce contractual obligations 
entered into by or through the Agency prior to June 1, 2017.260

6. Self-Direct Renewable Portfolio Standard Compliance Program 
6.1.  Introduction  
Public Act 102-0662 also introduced new Section 1-75(c)(1)(R) of the IPA Act into Illinois law; this 
new  subparagraph  requires  that  the  Illinois  Power  Agency  “establish  a  self-direct  renewable 
portfolio standard compliance program for eligible self-direct customers that purchase renewable 
energy credits from utility-scale wind and solar projects through long-term agreements.”  By law, and 
as described more extensively below, qualifying customers must meet certain size thresholds, while 
qualifying projects must be “new” projects sited in locations otherwise eligible for RPS compliance. 
This Chapter provides the IPA’s discussion of this new self-direct program, including how to address 
items left by statute to be settled through this Long-Term Plan.   
6.1.1.  Self-Direct Program Overview – What is a Self-Direct Program?  
Since enactment of the Future Energy Jobs Act (P.A. 99-0906), RPS compliance in Illinois has been 
managed by the Illinois Power Agency through its administration of programs and procurements.  
Requirements applicable to those programs and procurements are outlined in Illinois law, with 
further refinements, requirements, and operationalized approaches for how to meet RPS goals and 
targets  set  forth  through  the  IPA’s  biannually-developed  Long-Term  Renewable  Resources 
Procurement Plan.  Deliveries of renewable energy credits (“RECs”) are brought under contract 
through the IPA’s programs and procurements, with Illinois electric utilities serving as the Buyers 
and recipients of RECs produced by participating renewable energy projects.  Funding to support the 
purchase  of  RECs  is  provided  by  Illinois  electric  utility  ratepayers  through  volumetric,  non-
bypassable electric bill charges, with that funding providing needed revenue (and revenue certainty) 
back to developers of these of new renewable energy projects.   
As a restructured state, electric utilities do not and cannot own these renewable energy projects 
(subject to limited exceptions), and do not supply electricity to support most retail customer load—
most retail customer electric supply needs are instead met through competitive suppliers.  Instead, 
those utilities receive and retire RECs associated with energy that, in many cases, is sold separately 
from the transfer of RECs, with the retirement of those RECs allowing for the state to measure its 
progress against percentage-based RPS goals (e.g., “25% by 2025,” meaning that 25% of retail sales 
are to be met by REC retirements by 2025) or quantity-based targets (e.g., 2,000,000 RECs from new 
wind projects delivered annually by 2020).  Progress toward meeting RPS goals has thus been 
measured exclusively through projects participating in IPA programs and procurements, featuring 
RECs purchased by, delivered to, and retired by Illinois electric utilities.    
In general terms, an RPS self-direct program operates in contrast to the IPA-administered RPS 
activities in the following ways:  
1.  Under a self-direct program, RECs are received and retired by individual customers through 
its own purchases, rather than by the electric utility itself, thus allowing for that customer to 
retire those RECs and itself make environmental claims regarding the use of renewable 
energy.   
2.  As that customer is meeting RPS requirements through its own REC purchases, its electricity 
usage is no longer included in the denominator used to track the state’s broader RPS 
compliance.

130,138,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
3.  As that customer is engaged in its own REC procurement activities to support renewable 
energy procurement progress, it is credited back for or excused from some portion of non-
bypassable RPS charges levied to support RPS activities.   
As this RPS compliance occurs through private bilateral transactions entered into at the election of 
those private parties, rather than through a centralized planning process or by regulatory fiat, that 
RPS compliance pathway is viewed as “self-compliance” or “self-direct.”   
6.1.2.   Prior RPS Self-Direct Programs in Illinois  
Prior to the enactment of Public Act 99-0906, the Illinois RPS was met through centralized IPA 
planning only for those customers taking electric supply from Illinois electric utilities.  For those 
customers taking supply from an alternative retail electric supplier, Section 16-115D of the PUA 
provided a different path for compliance.  Each ARES—and not each individual customer—was 
required to satisfy a renewable portfolio standard requirement as a percentage of its electricity sales, 
but could satisfy its obligation by making alternative compliance payments at a rate reflecting that 
rate paid by default supply customers for no less than 50% of its RPS obligation.  For the remaining 
50% of its obligation, the ARES could either pay additional alternative compliance payments and/or 
self-procure  RECs.    Qualifying  RECs  needed  to be  sourced  from  facilities  within  the  regional 
transmission territories of PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (“PJM”) and Midcontinent Independent System 
Operator, Inc. (“MISO”), a relatively broad geographic footprint, and from any qualifying renewable 
energy technology.  
With ARES competing with one another for customers (and, for residential and small commercial 
customers, also competing against default supply service), this paradigm created an incentive for an 
ARES to comply at the lowest cost possible.   Thus, alternative compliance payments (“ACPs”) were 
generally made for the minimum 50% amount (as the rate applicable to those ACPs reflected more 
expensive procurements made by the Agency to support new project development, such as through 
the 2010 Long-Term Power Purchase Agreements used to support new wind and solar projects), and 
the self-procurement obligation was not structured to lead to the development of new renewable 
energy generation.  If RECs were available for purchase from facilities already built and financed, or 
from projects located in vertically-integrated states with development costs already covered by that 
state’s ratepayers, then those RECs could be utilized for compliance.   
This short-term, transactional incentive structure for ARES self-directed RPS compliance meant that 
very little new renewable generation was able to be developed through this compliance mechanism.  
Even though ARES were procuring millions of RECs in aggregate each year, the incentive structure 
facing those suppliers made it highly unlikely that those RECs would be sourced from anything other 
than the lowest-priced seller: these were generally facilities that had already been built and financed 
without reliance on this revenue stream, and potentially from projects in vertically integrated states 
with costs already being fully recovered through rates.  By contrast, supporting new development 
required long-term revenue certainty at REC prices likely higher than what already-constructed 
facilities could offer.  Furthermore, the RPS budget volatility introduced by customer load switching 
to and from ARES supply service presented significant planning challenges, with long-term contracts 
needed to provide revenue certainty to new projects disfavored given the year-over-year uncertainty 
about the presence of funding supporting those obligations.   
Public Act 99-0906 introduced a two-year sunset to this alternative ARES compliance mechanism, 
and by mid-2019, the entirety of RPS compliance (whether for default supply customers, ARES

customers, or hourly pricing customers) had transitioned to a centralized planning and procurement 
structured administered by the IPA.261  Through new Section 1-75(c)(1)(R), Illinois law now allows 
for a return to a self-direct structure—but with significant guardrails regarding the customer, 
qualifying facility, REC delivery contract, and self-direct benefit intended to ensure that participation 
in this self-direct program supports the spirit informing the Illinois RPS (namely, to support new 
renewable energy projects sited in areas that bring benefits back to Illinois residents and businesses).  
As the IPA believes that the challenges outlined above inform many of the requirements found in 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R), this background is vital for understanding why self-direct RPS compliance in 
Illinois has taken this particular form.   
6.2. Self-Direct Customer Eligibility  
One such area where limitations on self-direct participation can be found is in which customers may 
qualify.  By law, only “eligible self-direct customers” may qualify, and Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(1) 
provides the following definition to support that requirement:   
""Eligible self-direct customer"" means any retail customers of an electric utility that serves 
3,000,000 or more retail customers in the State and whose total highest 30-minute demand was 
more than 10,000 kilowatts, or any retail customers of an electric utility that serves less than 
3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State and whose total 
highest 15-minute demand was more than 10,000 kilowatts. 
This definition offers a few key limitations: first, the customer must be a retail customer of either 
Commonwealth Edison company or Ameren Illinois. Customers of municipal electric utilities, rural 
electric  co-operatives,  or  other  electric  utilities  (such  as  MidAmerican  Energy  Company)  are 
ineligible.  Second, the customer must be of at least a threshold size: 10,000 kilowatts of peak 
demand, which the IPA believes should be interpreted as non-coincident peak demand and evaluated 
based on customer billing information.  Meeting this threshold may be established by monthly utility 
bills or utility historical consumption reports, so long as that proof is derived from the 12 consecutive 
billing periods prior to the start of the year in which the application is filed.  Thus, the Illinois RPS 
self-direct compliance program is a large customer self-direct program for only customers of the 
largest Illinois electric utilities.   
Additional requirements apply to both the renewable energy facilities with which these customers 
contract for RECs, as well as the REC delivery contracts executed by those customers, as discussed 
further in this Chapter.   
6.2.1.  Common Parents  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(1) also provides a definition of “retail customer” that allows for account 
aggregation in the case of common corporate parents:   
""Retail customer"" has the meaning set forth in Section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act 
and multiple retail customer accounts under the same corporate parent may aggregate 
their  account  demands  to  meet  the  10,000  kilowatt  threshold.  The  criteria  for 
determining whether this subparagraph is applicable to a retail customer shall be based 
 
261 One limited exception is Section 1‐75(c)(1)(H)(i) of the IPA Act, which allows an ARES self-supply a finite quantity of RECs from 
qualifying renewable energy generating facilities owned by that ARES in exchange for a bill credit for its customers. See Section 3.6 for 
more information.

on the 12 consecutive billing periods prior to the start of the year in which the 
application is filed. 
Thus,  in  the  case  of  common  corporate  parents,  multiple  individual  accounts  from  affiliated 
companies (such as individual retail branch locations from the same company) may be aggregated 
for purposes of meeting this size threshold, and by extension for purposes of establishing those 
customer accounts which may benefit from the self-direct program through a reduced RPS charge.  
For an individual retail account to be eligible to be aggregated under a corporate parent’s application, 
the IPA will require that an individual retail account entity be a fully owned, integrated operation of 
the corporate parent or a subsidiary in which the corporate parent holds a controlling interest of 
more than 50 percent.  
For its filed Plan, the IPA had originally proposed that because bill crediting operates specific to each 
individual electric utility, the aggregated demand must be for individual accounts within one of the 
utilities’ service territories (with bill crediting then awarded by that utility specific to those qualifying 
customers of that utility)—and would not allow for aggregating individual accounts located across 
more than one utility service territory to meet the 10,000 kW threshold.  However, in ICC Docket No. 
22-0231 approving the Plan, the Commission instead concluded that the Plan “should be modified to 
reflect the ability of customers under the same corporate parent to aggregate their account demands 
to meet the 10,000 kW threshold and that customers must qualify their accounts according to the 
statutory definition of ‘Eligible self-direct customer’ for each of the utilities in which the customer 
has accounts that it seeks to aggregate to meet the 10,000 kW threshold.”262  While not crystal clear, 
the IPA understands the Commission’s Order adopts a proposal made by the NRG Companies and 
supported by other parties allowing for aggregation across utility service territories for affiliated 
customers seeking to meet the 10,000 kW demand threshold.  The Order additionally clarifies that 
“customer accounts may only receive the Self-Direct Program credit that is specific to the utility that 
serves that account.”263     
An example of how the aggregation of demand would be applied: Corporate Parent owns two 
manufacturing facilities—Facility A, which is in the ComEd service territory, and Facility B, which is 
in Ameren’s service territory. Facility A’s peak 30-minute demand of 7,000 kW can be combined with 
Facility B’s peak 15-minute demand of 4,000 kW to exceed the 10,000 kW threshold for self-direct 
program qualification. Facility A will receive the self-direct credit for ComEd customers, and Facility 
B will receive the self-direct credit for Ameren customers.  
During stakeholder comments, one question that arose was whether multiple affiliated government 
accounts could be aggregated to meet this retail customer threshold.  The IPA believes that, for 
example, the individual government buildings for a given municipality should be understood as 
featuring  the  same  “corporate  parent,”  but  less  obvious  cases  may  require  judgment  once 
applications are reviewed.  A certified resolution or affidavit from an appropriate municipal official 
that identifies the accounts that are controlled by the municipality is acceptable proof of eligibility 
for the 10,000 kilowatt threshold. However, individual customer accounts assembled under an 
aggregation contract (such as with opt-out municipal aggregation as contemplated under Section 1-
92 of the IPA Act) cannot qualify, unless those customers could separately establish a common 
corporate parent.  Neither can individual municipal accounts across municipalities joined together

by  an  Intergovernmental  Cooperation  Agreement,  as  the  character  of  an  intergovernmental 
agreement between multiple and separate municipalities more closely resembles a contractual 
relationship than a common corporate parent.264     
The IPA also understands that although eligibility for the self-direct program is expressly required to 
be based on the prior 12 billing periods, a customer could qualify for the self-direct program through 
monthly billing demonstrating that this 10,000 kilowatt threshold is met.  However, a customer 
lacking eligible billing history (such as a new customer or customers) could not qualify for the self-
direct program until qualifying billing history has been established.      
6.3. Project Eligibility  
To qualify, an eligible self-direct customer must hold a long-term contract for the delivery of RECs 
from  an  eligible  renewable  energy  generating  facility.    Section  1-75(c)(1)(R)  also  provides 
requirements applicable to those projects.  As a threshold matter, only utility-scale (above 5 MW) 
wind or photovoltaic projects may qualify.      
6.3.1.  “New” Projects  
Under Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(2)(vi) of the Act, RECs must be sourced “from new utility-scale wind 
projects or new utility-scale solar projects.”  Unlike Section 1-75(c)(1)(C)(iii), which expressly 
provides that “new” projects are those energized after June 1, 2017, Section 1-75(c)(1)(R) provides 
no definition of a “new” project.  However, because the definition of a new project found in Section 
1-75(c)(1)(C)(iii) is stated as broadly applying “[f]or purposes of this Section,” the IPA believes that 
energization after June 1, 2017 is the applicable threshold for whether a project may be considered 
“new” for self-direct RPS compliance purposes.265      
6.3.2.  Locational Requirements  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(2)(ii) provides that RECs must be sourced from a facility compliant with “the 
geographic requirements as set forth in subparagraph (I) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) as 
interpreted through the Agency's long-term renewable resources procurement plan, or, where 
applicable, the geographic requirements that governed utility-scale renewable energy credits at the 
time the eligible self-direct customer entered into the applicable renewable energy credit purchase 
agreement.”  This first half of this requirement is relatively straightforward; in Chapter 4, the IPA 
describes its approach to qualifying renewable energy projects located in adjacent states under 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) of the IPA Act.  Those facilities must meet a threshold score based on project 
application, and the Agency has a predetermination process for entities seeking to understand 
whether certain facilities qualify.  The public interest criteria that the Agency takes into consideration 
for this scoring are as follows: 
1.  Minimizing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and other pollution that 
adversely affects public health in Illinois; 
2.  Increasing fuel and resource diversity in Illinois; 
 
264 This conclusion was reaffirmed by the Commission in Docket No. 22-0231, in which the Commission stated that “[m]unicipalities that 
have entered into an intergovernmental agreement are not ‘under the same single corporate parent’ as required by the IPA Act.”  Docket 
No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 15.   
265 To support equivalent treatment between projects, the IPA does not understand “new” projects to include repowered projects, such as 
an existing wind farm featuring replaced turbines; otherwise, facilities may seek to repower well before the useful life of renewable energy 
generation equipment has expired in seeking a more lucrative REC delivery contract.

3.  Enhancing the reliability and resiliency of the electricity distribution system in Illinois; 
4.  Meeting goals to limit carbon dioxide emissions under federal or state law; and 
5.  Contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment for the citizens of Illinois. 
To assess whether a renewable generating facility located in an adjacent state that provides RECs to 
the self-direct customer so that the self-direct customer is eligible to participate in the program, the 
Agency assigns a maximum of 20 points to each of the five public interest criteria for a total of 100 
possible points.  For a renewable energy generating facility in an adjacent state to be able to supply 
RECs to a self-direct customer that would qualify to participate in the program, the adjacent state 
facility needs to demonstrate that it can achieve a total score of at least 60 points.  As this criteria and 
scoring has remained unchanged across the IPA’s Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement 
Plans published in 2017, 2019, 2021, and now in 2022, the process for determining locational facility 
eligibility for projects falling under Section 1-75(c)(1)(I)’s requirements should by now be known 
and straightforward.   
Less clear is the specific point in time at which this Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) criteria applied versus a 
preceding location construct.   While the scoring methodology and threshold score under Section 1-
75(c)(1)(I)’s public criteria were not finalized until the April 3, 2018 ICC approval of the IPA’s Long-
Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan, Section 1-75(c)(1)(G) of the Act required the Agency 
to conduct “initial forward procurements” for RECs delivered from new utility-scale wind and solar 
projects in advance of that criteria’s finalization (including as early as the Fall of 2017).  In outlining 
requirements applicable to projects participating in those initial forward procurements, the Agency 
determined the Section 1-75(c)(1)(I)’s requirements still-to-be-determined through the Long-Term 
Plan approval process must nevertheless apply, and thus that any participating adjacent state 
projects risked being excluded after receiving a contract award pending final determination of 
adjacent state criteria.  Thus, because the Agency previously applied these criteria to REC delivery 
contracts executed between June 1, 2017 (the effective date of P.A. 99-0906) and April 3, 2018 (the 
ICC’s approval of the IPA’s initial Long-Term Plan, and thus the point in time at which Section 1-
75(c)(1)(I)’s locational criteria was finalized), June 1, 2017 constitutes the date at which Section 1-
75(c)(1)(I)’s locational criteria became effective for Section 1-75(c)(1)(R) purposes.  
While no qualifying facility can have an energization date pre-dating June 1, 2017, it is possible that 
some REC supply contracts were nevertheless executed before June 1, 2017 for projects still under 
development.  In this case, the precursor to Section 1-75(c)(1)(I) was the “Illinois and adjacent state” 
preference then found in Section 1-75(c)(1) of the IPA Act—through which, under competitive 
procurements,  RECs  from  Illinois  and  adjacent  states  were  given  selection  priority,  with 
consideration of RECs from elsewhere only provided if procurement quantities could not be met 
through Illinois and adjacent state projects.  The IPA thus understands that should a qualifying REC 
supply contract have been entered into before June 1, 2017, that facility may be located anywhere 
within Illinois or an adjacent state, but not outside of that footprint.      
6.3.3.  Labor and DEI Requirements  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(2)(vii) requires that, for self-direct REC delivery contracts entered into after 
the September 15, 2021 effective date of Public Act 102-0662, “the new utility-scale wind projects or 
new utility-scale solar projects must comply with the requirements established in subparagraphs (P) 
and (Q) of paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) and subsection (c-10).”

135,143,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
With respect to project labor requirements found in subparagraph (Q), projects will be required to 
comply with both the Prevailing Wage Act and to enter into a project labor agreement, as required 
for utility-scale wind and solar projects under Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q)(2) of the Act.  For Prevailing 
Wage Act compliance, customers will be required to submit certified transcripts of payroll applicable 
to those facilities in a manner mirroring requirements applicable to projects under development 
under the Adjustable Block Program, as outlined in Chapter 7.  For project labor agreements, the 
timing for the receipt of such agreements, and the content required within such agreements, will 
mirror  requirements  applicable  to  utility-scale  projects  participating  in  IPA  procurements  as 
outlined in Chapter 5; whether such agreements qualify will be based on both the body of the PLA 
and any addenda thereto.  Additional details on processes for submittal will be made available as the 
IPA develops self-direct RPS program application forms and processes.     
With respect to the diversity, equity, and inclusion requirements found in subsection (c-10), projects 
must  comply  with  the  minimum  equity  standard  and  the  associated  planning  and  reporting 
requirements detailed in Chapter 10. The self-direct customer shall submit a Minimum Equity 
Standard Compliance Plan with its application to the program and report on compliance as part of its 
annual report required pursuant to Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(3) and discussed further in Section 6.9 
below. The minimum equity standard that is in place at the time of approval of the customer’s 
participation  in  the  self-direct  program  will  be  the  percentage  standard  applicable  to  the 
construction of the new utility-scale wind or solar project from which that customer receives and 
retires RECs.   
Additional information on compliance with minimum equity standards will be made available after 
the conclusion of this proceeding, after minimum equity standards applicable to utility-scale projects 
participating  directly  in  IPA-administered  competitive  procurements  have  been  finalized  and 
approved by the Commission.  The Agency plans to hold a stakeholder comment process on how best 
to mesh self-direct program participation (which takes place through large retail customers) with 
equity standards compliance (which generally concerns project development).   
With  respect  to  the  requirements  of  subparagraph  (P),  priority  in  selection  will  be  given  to 
applications featuring projects located in Energy Transition Community Grant communities should 
the program receive qualified applications exceeding program size.  That approach is outlined in 
Section 6.6.3 below.     
6.4. REC Delivery Contract Eligibility   
Even with a qualifying customer and qualifying project, certain Section 1-75(c)(1)(R) requirements 
also apply to the legal instrument through which that customer receives RECs from that “new,” 
locationally-appropriate utility-scale wind or utility-scale solar facility.  Notably, that instrument 
need not be exclusively for RECs; bundled agreements (including, e.g., delivery of energy) may also 
qualify, so long as REC delivery requirements are met through those instruments.  By extension, 
delivery to the customer may also occur through an instrument executed with an intermediary, such 
as an alternative retail electric supplier; however, any instruments executed with an intermediary 
(i.e., not with the qualifying facility itself) must be structured to ensure that sufficient quantities of 
RECs will be delivered from qualifying facilities across the minimum contract term—and cannot be 
open-ended as to the specific source of RECs.

136,144,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
6.4.1.  Contract Term  
Mirroring the long-term REC delivery contracts provided for elsewhere throughout Section 1-
75(c)(1) of the IPA Act, Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(2)(iii) requires that RECs “be procured through long-
term contracts with term lengths of at least 10 years” from qualifying facilities.  The IPA understands 
that this requirement is intended to help ensure that qualifying facilities may not have been built but 
for the REC delivery contract that provided long-term revenue certainty back to that facility, and thus 
that the Illinois RPS self-direct program provides benefits to credit new renewable energy project 
development.   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)’s requirements do not apparently require 10 years of REC deliveries from the 
date of application into the program; instead, only that the contract term itself is at least 10 years in 
length.  Consequently, the IPA understands that a customer could already be receiving RECs under a 
qualifying REC delivery contract at the time of application to the program in 2023 with less than 10 
years of deliveries remaining, and benefit from self-direct participation for the remaining years of 
that contract.  However, the IPA believes that should any aspect of that contract have been non-
compliant with self-direct program requirements, then 10 years of deliveries under compliant terms 
is required to meet this contract length threshold.       
As discussed further in this Chapter, to demonstrate compliance with these and other requirements, 
applicant customers will generally need to provide the legal instrument through which RECs are 
required to be delivered as supporting evidence.   
6.4.2.  Delivery Quantity Requirement  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(2)(iv) requires that RECs delivered to an eligible self-direct customer from a 
qualifying facility or facilities “be equivalent in volume to at least 40% of the eligible self-direct 
customer's usage, determined annually by the eligible self-direct customer's usage during the 
previous delivery year, measured to the nearest megawatt-hour.”  Thus, if a customer used 10,000 
megawatt-hours in the previous delivery year, then the contracted delivery quantity must be at least 
4,000 RECs.  A customer can receive and retire additional RECs from that same facility, although no 
additional credit is provided beyond the applicable published self-direct credit amount,266 with that 
published self-direct credit amount then applying to the entirety of that customer’s load.  Thus, the 
self-direct credit operates in a binary manner—if a customer qualifies, then the entirety of the 
customer’s volumetric RPS charges are credited accordingly, with that customer’s load no longer 
included in the denominator used for determining how many RECs must be procured by the IPA to 
meet Section 1-75(c)(1)’s RPS goals.  However, if a customer fails to meet this 40% threshold, then 
no credit is provided, and the customer simply fails to qualify for the self-direct program.   
This raises the question of whether that 40% threshold is determined annually for compliance as 
customer usage changes, or a one-time threshold determination for that customer’s eligibility.  In 
light of Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(5)’s instruction that “[o]nce the Agency determines that a self-direct 
customer is eligible for participation in the program, the self-direct customer will remain eligible 
until the end of the term of the contract,” and given the administrative burden of annually comparing 
customer usage to REC deliveries (and then possibly distinguishing between good faith non-
 
266 This conclusion was reinforced by the Illinois Commerce Commission’s Final Order in Docket No. 22-0231.  That Order clarified that 
“[t]he 40% threshold in the statute is an eligibility criteria, nothing in the statute suggests that the credit should be scaled based on the 
level of RECs purchased” and thus declined to adopt a proposal under which REC procurements above that 40% threshold would have 
resulted in an increased self-direct credit back to the customer.  Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 39.

compliance versus gaming), the IPA believes that an initial determination that the legal instrument 
is structured to meet 40% of the customer’s usage through REC deliveries will be generally sufficient.  
However, the Agency reserves the right to make inquiries of customers should it have reason to 
believe that this threshold is consistently being missed and may take action under Section 1-
75(c)(1)(R)(6) of the Act should that customer fail to provide documentation demonstrating ongoing 
compliance (including through required annual compliance reporting, as discussed in Section 6.9 
below).  Similarly, the Agency believes that eligibility should be based upon meeting the 10,000 
kilowatt threshold at the time of application approval.  Should the customer’s demand subsequently 
decline below the 10,000 kilowatt threshold, that demand decline would not invalidate an approved 
customer’s established eligibility. 
6.5. Self-Direct Crediting and Accounting  
As customers may already engage in any of the qualifying REC delivery contracting contemplated in 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R), the benefit of self-direct RPS program participation for an eligible self-direct 
customer is simply a reduction in the non-bypassable charges levied by Illinois electric utilities to 
support RPS activities (or a “credit” against those charges).  The methodology for determining bill 
credits for participating customers is outlined in Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(4) of the IPA Act, and the IPA 
explains its understanding of that bill crediting methodology further below.     
Meanwhile, the benefit to the State of Illinois in providing the self-direct program is a reduction in 
the quantity of RECs required to be procured through IPA-administered utility-scale procurements, 
as “[e]ach renewable energy credit procured . . . by a self-direct customer shall reduce the total 
volume of renewable energy credits the Agency is otherwise required to procure from new utility-
scale projects.”  Thus, while the self-direct program does result in a reduction of available RPS 
budgets, it also allows the Illinois RPS to recognize private sector renewable energy support through 
a reduction in required REC procurement quantities.  Further, the requirement that contracts be at 
least 10 years in length reduces the year-to-year budget volatility resultant from other possible self-
direct regimes.   
6.5.1.  Self-Direct Bill Crediting  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(4) authorizes a “reduction in the volumetric charges collected pursuant to 
Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act for approved eligible self-direct customers” as those 
customers’ benefit for self-direct program participation.  As this program operates as an self-direct 
RPS compliance program only, the IPA understands “volumetric charges collected pursuant to 
Section 16-108” to refer only to those charges utilized to support RPS program and procurement 
activities pursuant to Section 16-108(k) of the PUA, and not charges used to support the procurement 
of zero emission credits, carbon mitigation credits, Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative 
Charges, or other collections and initiatives referenced in Section 16-108(k).   
That reduction, or “credit,” is calculated to be “equivalent to the anticipated cost of renewable energy 
credit deliveries under contracts for new utility-scale wind and new utility-scale solar entered for 
each delivery year after the large energy customer begins retiring eligible new utility scale renewable 
energy credits for self-compliance.”  Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(4) further clarifies that the self-direct 
credit amount shall be “equal to the estimated portion of the cost authorized by subparagraph (E) of 
paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) that supported the annual procurement of utility-scale renewable 
energy credits in the prior delivery year using a methodology described in the long-term renewable 
resources procurement plan, expressed on a per kilowatthour basis.”   By law, the credit back to the

customer cannot include “costs associated with any contracts entered into before the delivery year 
in which the customer files the initial compliance report to be eligible for participation in the self-
direct program” or “costs associated with procuring renewable energy credits through existing and 
future contracts through the Adjustable Block Program, subsection (c-5) of this Section 1-75, and the 
Solar  for  All  Program,”  although  as  the  ICC  recognized  in  Docket  No.  22-0231,  Section  1-
75(c)(1)(R)(4)’s reliance on crediting the “estimated portion” of utility-scale REC delivery costs could 
create overlap into actual costs from those categories.267      
6.5.1.1.  Self-Direct Bill Crediting: Interpretive Issues  
As described under this language, this calculation has multiple parts, including some contradictory 
elements.  The credit back to that customer hinges then on the “anticipated cost of renewable energy 
credit deliveries under contracts for new utility-scale wind and new utility-scale solar entered for 
each delivery year after” that participation begins.  But that credit must be must also be “the 
estimated portion of the cost authorized by subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) 
that supported the annual procurement of utility-scale renewable energy credits in the prior delivery 
year.”  Reconciling this language is not easy, but certain framing principles emerge that the IPA 
believes are appropriate for implementation of the self-direct program. 
As outlined above and reinforced by the Illinois Commerce Commission in Docket No. 22-0231, self-
direct  bill  crediting  concerns  only  costs  reflective  of  utility-scale  wind  and  utility-scale  solar 
procurements, and expressly not “costs associated with procuring renewable energy credits through 
existing and future contracts through the Adjustable Block Program, subsection (c-5) of this Section 
1-75, and the Solar for All Program.”  This provides a defined universe of contract types for which 
costs can be utilized in establishing bill crediting levels.  Self-direct bill crediting should also not 
include “costs associated with any contracts entered into before the delivery year in which the 
customer files the initial compliance report to be eligible for participation in the self-direct program,” 
but this limitation introduces problematic variance in the self-direct credit level by basing that credit 
level on the specific year of a given customer’s self-direct participation.     
The Illinois Commerce Commission addressed these issues in approving the IPA’s Long-Term 
Renewable Resources Procurement Plan in Docket No. 22-0231.  The IPA’s filed Plan had originally 
proposed that a customer’s crediting level be pegged to that customer’s first year of self-direct 
program participation, with only REC delivery contract costs for utility-scale REC contracts entered 
into after that participation providing the universe of contracts whose costs could be credited back 
to customers.  In its Final Order approving the Plan, the Commission concluded that “it is more 
appropriate that a three-year rolling average of eligible utility-scale REC delivery contracts be used, 
consisting of the two-years prior to the year being determined and the third year  being the 
anticipated costs” outlined in the Plan.268  This approach both addressed the Commission’s concern 
that establishing the credit based on the self-direct customer’s participation date “instills too much 
instability for Self-Direct Program participants”269 while also ensuring that only costs associated with 
utility-scale REC delivery contracts were credited.

Based on the IPA’s understanding of the Commission’s Order, self-direct crediting levels are still to 
be determined annually—the Commission states that “the IPA’s proposed implementation of the 
requirement to annually calculate the credit,  which provides different credit levels based on a 
customer’s date of enrollment” is what offers undesirable instability, and a methodology which looks 
at “two year priors to the year being determined and the third year being the anticipated costs” will 
necessarily require a different determination annually—but self-direct crediting levels are fixed 
across all participants for a given delivery year, regardless of that customer’s first year of self-direct 
program participation.    
The Commission’s direction regarding the use of a three-year rolling average did not explicitly 
address how the costs for each of the three years should be determined. The Commission explained 
that the averaging approach would “reflect [the] statutory inconsistencies” and directed that “a three-
year rolling average of eligible utility-scale REC delivery contracts be used, consisting of the two-
years prior to the year being determined and the third year being the anticipated costs as outlined in 
the  [Plan].”270  The  Order  does  not  elaborate  on  which  utility-scale  REC  contracts  should  be 
considered “eligible,” nor does it reference the section of the Plan it is referring to regarding 
anticipated costs. The Order might be understood to mean that only costs reflecting new contracts in 
each of the three years should be considered. The Order might alternatively be read to mean that the 
costs for all utility-scale RECs procured by the IPA for RPS compliance count for the previous two 
years (regardless of when the contracts were entered into), but that for the future (third) year, the 
Agency should use the methodology proposed in the Plan and limit the costs to those for new 
contracts. Finally, the Order could be read to mean that actual or expected costs from all utility-scale 
REC contracts used for RPS compliance should be considered (regardless of when the contracts were 
entered into) for each of the three years.  
The first of these options (only considering costs from new contracts in each of the three years) is 
problematic because of the lag between when the Agency enters into contracts for utility-scale REC 
procurement, and when those RECs are actually delivered and paid for. New utility-scale REC 
contracts virtually never have “costs” in the first year, so the credit would be set to zero for much or 
all of the time. This does not appear to be consistent with the Commission’s intent, as the Commission 
expressly stated that it sought to avoid a lag between participation and crediting. 
The second option (considering utility-scale contracts regardless of year entered into for the 
previous two years, but only considering new contracts for the future year) is problematic because 
that methodology would not produce a rolling average. To calculate a three-year rolling average, each 
calculation removes the data for the first year, retains the data for the second and third years, and 
adds in a new subsequent year, thereby “shifting” the three-year window forward by one year. If the 
Agency limited the costs for the “future” or third year to only new contracts, but included contracts 
regardless of age for the “previous” years one and two, it would be mixing apples and oranges. Each 
new calculation shifting the window would change the cost amount for individual years, because the 
universe of contracts (and therefore costs) would change.  
The Agency believes the third option is the best interpretation of the Commission’s Order: including 
costs for utility-scale REC contracts regardless of when the contracts were entered into in calculating 
the costs for each of the three years. This allows the Agency to calculate a three-year rolling average 
as directed by the Commission, and the resulting credit amount will be a non-zero number, which

appears to best reflect the Commission’s desire to avoid a lag between participation and crediting. As 
the Commission acknowledges in its Order, it could be argued that this approach is inconsistent with 
the statutory directive to “not include . . . costs associated with any contracts entered into before the 
delivery year in which the customer files the initial compliance report to be eligible for participation 
in the self-direct program.”271  
However, it is essentially impossible for an approach to comply with the requirement to not include 
costs associated with pre-existing contracts and also comply with the Commission’s directions to 1) 
apply the same annual credit amount to all self-direct customers, regardless of when the customers 
began participation, and 2) avoid a lag between participation and crediting. Compliance with both 
directions would only be possible if the credit (that applied to all self-direct customers) was limited 
to costs for utility-scale REC contracts entered into after the date that the most recent self-direct 
customer began participating; this would likely reset the credit to zero or near zero each time a new 
self-direct customer begins participating. This seems entirely inconsistent with the Commission’s 
intent. Therefore, in light of the conflicting directives, the Agency will follow the approach that 
appears to best integrate both the statutory language and the Commission Order. That is, the Agency 
will determine the self-direct credit each year based on the costs for utility-scale REC contracts in the 
previous two years and anticipated costs for the next year, regardless of what year the underlying 
REC contract was signed.  
The Commission must “approve the self-direct credit amount by June 1, 2023 and June 1 of each 
delivery year thereafter.”  Under the methodology outlined in the Commission’s Order, the IPA 
understands that its compliance filing seeking approval of the amount thus must include a credit 
value “expressed on a per kilowatt hour basis” that would apply to all participants.  Notably, if the 
IPA’s understanding of this methodology is incorrect, parties may contest the proposed self-direct 
values before the Commission and the Commission will provide a vote affirming those values before 
finalization.   
This crediting approach reflects something akin to a “like for like” crediting by class of expenditure—
the customer’s bill crediting level is determined using only utility-scale project RPS costs, based on 
an average of those costs to the RPS budget over a three-year period, and should not reflect costs 
used to support the ABP or ILSFA programs.     
6.5.1.2.  Self-Direct Bill Crediting Example  
Consistent  with  the  express  limitations  of  Section  1-75(c)(1)(R)(4)  and  the  Commission’s 
interpretive decisions from Docket No. 22-0231, the following is an example of how the Agency 
understands a self-direct crediting rate to be established.  The Commission’s Order requires that “a 
three-year rolling average of eligible utility-scale REC delivery contracts be used, consisting of the 
two-years prior to the year being determined and the third year being the anticipated costs as 
outlined in the [draft] LTRRPP.”272  For illustrative purposes, assume participation for the 2023 
delivery year (the first year of the program).  For this example, the IPA will average the RPS budget 
impacts for  utility-scale REC delivery contracts across the 2021-22 and 2022-23 delivery years 
regardless of when such contracts were executed and anticipated procurement costs associated with 
those contracts for the upcoming (2023-24) delivery year.  Similarly, self-direct crediting for the

141,149,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
2025 delivery year would be dependent on actual utility-scale REC delivery contract costs from the 
2023 and 2024 delivery years and anticipated costs for the 2025 delivery year.  Anticipated costs 
would be determined through a) the Agency’s estimate of by when those projects will become 
energized and begin delivering RECs, and b) the Agency’s anticipated budget impacts from those 
contracts based on its forward price curve calculation under Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(v).     
As distinguished from the proposal found in the filed Plan, one possible benefit of this approach is 
the presence of a single self-direct crediting rate for a given program year. A “three-year rolling 
average” will change year by year as the delivery years to compute that average change and those 
years’ costs vary. But, for the 2027 delivery year, a customer with initial participation in 2024 would 
receive the same crediting level as a customer with initial participation in 2026—even if that 
crediting level will be different in the 2028 delivery year.     
These anticipated delivery year costs would then be reduced down to an average fractional amount 
of the amount of collections authorized under Section 1-75(c)(1)(E) of the Act for the three delivery 
years.  That fractional amount may be expressed as a percentage, and that percentage would then be 
used for a per kwh calculation of the credit due back to participating customers.  Thus, if the 
volumetric RPS charge authorized by Section 1-75(c)(1)(E) was 1 cent per kilowatt hour, and 
anticipated qualifying contract costs constituted 10% of the RPS expenditures across those three 
years, then the applicable self-direct credit would be calculated as 0.1 cents per kilowatt hour.  That 
crediting level would then be applied to the entirety of that customer’s load so long as that customer 
was retiring the qualifying percentage of RECs (at least 40% of load); for additional REC retirements 
beyond 40%, the law does not contemplate an adjustment in crediting rate and the customer would 
continue to be able to claim the environmental benefits of that renewable energy usage.   
6.5.1.3.  Self-Direct Bill Crediting: Compliance Filing  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(4) also requires that the IPA annually calculate the self-direct crediting 
amount(s) and “submit this to the Commission in an annual compliance filing,” with the Commission 
required to “approve the self-direct credit amount by June 1, 2023 and June 1 of each delivery year 
thereafter.”  This provision raises a series of procedural questions, as outlined below.   
The first question is in what proceeding the Agency should provide its compliance filing.  The Agency 
believes that the proceeding featuring the most recently approved Long-Term Plan should be the 
proceeding in which a compliance filing is made.  Thus, for 2023, the Agency will submit its self-direct 
crediting calculation within the proceeding used to approve this Long-Term Plan.   
The second question concerns how the Commission is to “approve the self-direct amount,” as the 
Commission does not traditionally “approve” a compliance filing.  Instead, a compliance filing is 
simply made to ensure compliance with a prior Commission directive; but unless prompted by a 
reopening or motion, no Commission action is required.  Here, the IPA believes it can best manage 
the tension between Commission approval and the form of a compliance filing by a) engaging 
stakeholders in a comment process on the self-direct crediting rate prior to making its compliance 
filing and b) making its compliance filing early enough to allow for any parties to challenge that filing 
through petition to the Commission.  Further, under the Commission’s Order in Docket No. 22-0231, 
the Commission must take an overt action every year to approve the self-direct credits, in the same 
141

142,150,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
manner as the Commission approves benchmarks utilized for competitive procurements.273  Thus, 
after the IPA’s compliance filing and after allowing sufficient time for parties to contest that filing, the 
Commission shall place on its agenda a vote to approve the self-direct credit.274     
The third question concerns timing: while the Commission must approve a self-direct crediting 
amount by June 1 – the start of a delivery year – the Agency understands that this amount must be 
known to Illinois electric utilities well before June 1 for application within the delivery year beginning 
June 1.  The Agency has proposed a schedule for the first year of the self-direct program later in this 
Chapter and hopes that schedule may accommodate the utilities’ bill crediting calculation needs.     
For the substance of the compliance filing, the Agency will include, at minimum, the following: actual 
or anticipated costs of utility-scale REC delivery contracts by delivery year for the three years utilized 
for the rolling average, including the anticipated volumes of REC deliveries from those projects and 
aggregated assumptions about price (mindful of the confidentiality of individual bid prices) and a 
narrative explanation of how and why those calculations were made, as well as the self-direct credit 
applicable to all customers expressed as a per kilowatt-hour value.  As the self-direct program confers 
a benefit onto a large energy customer that is not otherwise available to other customers, the 
compliance filing may also include an identification of participating customers and renewable energy 
projects.   
Separate from that compliance filing, Section 1-125(b)(5) of the IPA Act also now requires the Agency 
to report annually on “the total amount of customer load featuring renewable portfolio standard 
compliance obligations scheduled to be met by self-direct customers” pursuant to the self-direct 
program,  as well as “the minimum annual quantities of renewable energy credits scheduled to be 
retired by those customers and amount of installed renewable energy generating capacity used to 
meet” the self-direct program’s requirements.   
6.5.2.  Procurement Target Adjustments    
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(3) provides that each REC procured in connection with the self-direct program 
“shall reduce the total volume of renewable energy credits the Agency is otherwise required to 
procure from new utility-scale projects pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of this 
subsection (c) on behalf of contracting utilities where the eligible self-direct customer is located.”  
The Agency will include estimates of RECs procured in connection with the self-direct program, as 
well as anticipated RPS budget adjustments necessitated by self-direct program bill crediting, in its 
analyses of RPS Goals, Targets, and Budgets produced through its Long-Term Plans and interim 
updates posted on its website.   
6.6. Self-Direct Program Size & Selection   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(3) requires that the Agency shall “annually determine the amount of utility-
scale renewable energy credits it will include each year from the self-direct renewable portfolio 
standard compliance program.”  In making this determination, “the Agency shall evaluate publicly 
available analyses and studies of the potential market size for utility-scale renewable energy long-
term purchase agreements by commercial and industrial energy customers and make that report 
publicly available.”  The Agency did not seek to establish a fixed first-year program size through this

Plan’s approval, and instead determined that it would be inappropriate to do so until after the Plan’s 
approval by the Commission (after which all parties now have more certainty regarding the self-
direct program’s mechanics).   
6.6.1.  Current Publicly Available Analyses and Studies    
Publicly available analyses and studies of the potential market size for utility-scale renewable energy 
long-term purchase agreements by commercial and industrial energy customers include analyses of 
large commercial and industrial (“C&I”) customer purchases of RECs or bundled renewable energy 
and RECs from utility-scale renewable resources through power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) or 
virtual power purchase agreements (“VPPAs”).  PPAs require the delivery of electricity sold under 
the agreement to the buyer, while VPPAs are financial transactions.  VPPAs provide corporate buyers 
with flexibility in terms of the location of the renewable resource in that the renewable energy is not 
necessarily delivered to the buyer’s specific location and allows the buyer to hedge exposure to 
wholesale market prices through a bundled financial transaction.   
Data regarding the capacity and generation associated with large C&I PPAs and VPPAs announced or 
executed with utility-scale wind and solar projects are available from several sources,275 although 
none of these data sources offer a comprehensive assessment of the potential size of the C&I self-
direct market in Illinois specifically.  Several relevant studies conducted by third parties are currently 
available.276  The Agency can also utilize the latest C&I consumption and utility scale renewable 
generation data available from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) to define the 
overall size of the commercial and industrial electricity markets, as well as the amount of utility-scale 
wind and utility-scale solar capacity and generation in Illinois.277   
The  EIA  reported  that  for  2020,  sales  of  electricity  to  ultimate  customers  in  Illinois  for  the 
Commercial Sector amounted to 45,915,000 MWh, down from 49,279,000 MWh in 2019, and for the 
Industrial Sector 39,105,000 MWh in 2020, down from 43,250,000 MWh in 2019.278 Generation from 
utility-scale wind and utility-scale solar projects for 2020 was reported as 17,204,000 MWh, 
reflecting utility-scale wind capacity of 6,329 MW and utility-scale solar capacity of 115.7 MW.  Most 
of this generation and the associated capacity were not supplied directly to large C&I customers 
under PPAs or VPPAs.  More specific data is available from various sources that typically report the 
amount of C&I renewable contract activity in terms of capacity, which can be converted to estimated 
generation using historical capacity factors relevant to each technology.   
However, total capacity in operation in any year does not provide an accurate indication of the likely 
size of the Self-Direct Customer market.  Historical annual capacity additions are a better indicator 
of what can be expected for the number of RECs that could be procured annually through the Self-

Buyers Association (CEBA), “CEBA Deal Tracker”, “CEBA State of the Market Report.”, and Green Biz Clean Energy Deal Tracker. 
276 In determining program size, the Agency plans to review the currently available or updated studies including (i) S&P Global Market 
Intelligence, RRA Regulatory Focus, 2021 Corporate Renewables Outlook, April 21, 2021., (ii) J.Kobus, A.I. Nasrallah, J. Guidera, Columbia,

Leadership & Rankings.”, March 2020. The Agency will also review other studies that may become available.

Direct RPS Compliance Program.  The Retail Industry Leaders Association, based on data obtained 
from the Clean Energy Buyers Association, the Solar Energy Industries Association, and the American 
Wind Energy Association, reported that the procurement of electricity from offsite third-party utility-
scale wind and utility-scale solar projects in Illinois increased from 175 MW in 2017 to 988 MW in 
2020 or an annual average of 271 MW during that period.279  Assuming a capacity factor of 30%, this 
would be equivalent to 712,188 RECs during each of those years. 
S&P Global Market Intelligence indicated that as of early 2021 there were almost 3,300 MW of 
corporate renewable energy deals in place in Illinois.280  Table 6-1 provides a summary of the specific 
C&I renewable agreements with utility-scale wind and utility-scale solar projects in Illinois reported 
by S&P Global.

While this is not a complete list of the C&I renewable resource agreements with utility-scale wind 
and utility-scale solar projects in Illinois, it is representative of the deals in the market—which may 
provide an indication of the number of RECs that could be procured through the Self-Direct RPS 
Compliance Program.  The reported Amazon deals would produce approximately 762,120 RECs in 
the first full year of operations for these projects.

In 2020 a total of 700 MW of renewable energy contracts in Illinois were announced, which would 
produce approximately 1,839,600 RECs.  
In response to the IPA’s request for interested party comments on the size of the self-direct market, 
Advanced Energy Economy and TechNet recommended that the program size should be 4,000 MW. 
This program size recommendation is based on the 2021 Columbia study that new U.S. corporate 
renewable energy capacity additions through 2030 would range from 55 GW to 85 MW.  Assuming 
that these capacity additions in Illinois would be in line with the EIA data that shows Illinois 
electricity sales to be approximately 3.6% of total U.S. electricity sales, then the new corporate 
renewable energy capacity for Illinois would be 3.6% of the total for the U.S. or in the range of 1,980 
MW to 3,060 MW.   To this range, TechNet added Advanced Energy Economy’s estimate of 1,650 MW 
of existing corporate renewable energy capacity to yield an estimate of the self-direct market size of 
3,630 MW to 4,710 MW which was rounded to 4,000 MW.283    
6.6.2.  Establishing Program Size  
The Agency plans to evaluate the studies and the data available from the sources discussed above, 
including updates to the studies and data, to produce an annual report which will include an 
assessment of the large C&I customer renewable energy market and estimates of the number of RECs 
expected to be available from eligible C&I customers each year.  Analysis included in the report will 
also consider any applications from the prior year that could not be supported under that year’s 
program size.  That report will be made available by early January of each year—with the first such 
report to be published in January 2023—and followed by a brief stakeholder comment process.  After 
the conclusion of that comment process, the Agency plans to announce the program size for the

upcoming year delivery by February 1 of that calendar year.  That program size will be published by 
RECs, as envisioned under the law (“The Agency shall annually determine the amount of utility-scale 
renewable energy credits it will include each year…”), but illustrative examples of installed capacity 
needed to meet those REC totals by technology will also be provided.     
The Agency is also considering a Request for Information process through which potentially-
interested self-direct customers could identify themselves to the Agency to help inform market size, 
and hopes to work with both alternative retail electric suppliers and electric utilities involved with 
bill crediting on promoting the self-direct program.  The Agency will also consider developing 
standardized materials about the program to assist in encouraging participation.     
6.6.3.  Selecting Between Competing Applications  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(3) also provides that “[i]f demand for participation in the self-direct renewable 
portfolio standard compliance program exceeds availability, the Agency shall ensure participation is 
evenly split between commercial and industrial users to the extent there is sufficient demand from 
both customer classes.”  This requirement contemplates that self-direct program applications will 
not be reviewed and approved on a rolling basis, but instead will feature an application window 
during which all applications are reviewed and determinations about selection – such as application 
of this C&I balancing requirement – will be made at the conclusion of that window closing.  As 
explained  later  in  this  Chapter,  the  Agency  proposes  to  structure  its  application  process  in 
accordance with this structure.   
This balancing requirement will operate to ensure that should the Agency receive more qualifying 
applications  than  program  capacity  can  support,  priority  shall  be  offered  to  ensure  equal 
participation between commercial customers and industrial customers.  Thus, if program size is 
100x, and the Agency has received 70x of qualifying commercial customer applications and 50x of 
qualifying industrial applications, then the 20x of applications not selected should be taken from the 
commercial customer segment.   
However, this does not provide direction between how to choose between competing applications 
within those categories.  Informed by stakeholder comments received, the Agency proposes the 
following approach to application selection should qualified applications exceed self-direct program 
capacity:   
First, the Agency will select applications in a manner consistent with the statutorily-mandated C&I 
balancing requirement—thus, if less than half of the program size is met through commercial or 
industrial customers, then all applications within that category will be considered selected.  If both 
categories have applications exceeding 50% of program capacity, then applications shall be selected 
within a category consistent with the following paragraphs.   
Next, customers with the highest percentage of RECs sourced from facilities located in Energy 
Transition Community Grant areas will be given preference.  This approach will help support 
communities impacted by the closure of coal mines, fossil fuel and nuclear plants and provide the 
commensurate employment opportunities that come from project development.  This approach 
aligns the self-direct program with Section 1-75(c)(1)(P) of the IPA Act prioritization of support for 
those communities. 
To next choose between any leftover competing applications within a given category (for instance, if 
no customer’s projects are located in Energy Transition Community Grant areas), the Agency shall

147,155,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
give priority to those applications which demonstrate the highest percentage of qualifying RECs 
being retired relative to that customer’s usage from the previous delivery year.  Thus, a contract 
through which a customer’s usage is entirely met through a bundled (REC + energy) PPA or PPAs 
would receive top priority.   
Lastly, priority will be provided based on the total number of RECs planned to be procured and 
retired annually under the application.   
Projects not selected will be placed on an ordinal waitlist ranked in accordance with the criteria 
above.  Those projects will be required to reapply for consideration for the next program year, but 
once qualified, will be provided top priority in selection for that year.   
6.7. Self-Direct Program Application Process  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(5) provides a minimum series of items required to be included on a customer’s 
application be a self-direct customer; those are outlined below:   
(i) the customer's certification that, at the time of the customer's application, the customer 
qualifies to be a self-direct eligible customer, including documents demonstrating that 
qualification; 
(ii) the customer's certification that the customer has entered into or will enter into by the 
beginning of the applicable procurement year, one or more bilateral contracts for new wind 
projects or new photovoltaic projects, including supporting documentation; 
(iii) certification that the contract or contracts for new renewable energy resources are long-
term contracts with term lengths of at least 10 years, including supporting documentation; 
(iv) certification of the quantities of renewable energy credits that the customer will purchase 
each year under such contract or contracts, including supporting documentation; 
(v) proof that the contract is sufficient to produce renewable energy credits to be equivalent 
in volume to at least 40% of the large energy customer's usage from the previous delivery 
year, measured to the nearest megawatt-hour; and 
(vi) certification that the customer intends to maintain the contract for the duration of the 
length of the contract. 
Specific application forms will be developed by the Agency across late 2022 and early 2023, and 
guidance regarding acceptable supporting evidence and documentation will be provided prior to the 
program’s opening for application.  At first blush, the Agency believes that supporting documentation 
demonstrating (i) through (v) will include requiring a combination of customer billing information 
(which is already required under Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(3)) and the underlying legal instrument 
through which the customer will procure RECs, with the applicant customer having the option of 
redacting any confidential, non-essential information.   
As Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(5)(ii) contemplates situations where the customer merely “will enter into” 
such contracts “by the beginning of the applicable procurement year,” a term sheet coupled with 
certification may be adequate to satisfy this requirement for initial application, but participation will 
be contingent on a binding REC delivery contract being provided to the Agency at least one month in 
advance of the start of the delivery year.

148,156,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
For  purposes  of  demonstrating  common  corporate  parent  status,  the  Agency  believes  tax 
identification numbers constitute appropriate proof, but not the only form of acceptable proof.  
Alternative proof for meeting this requirement and other requirements may be considered on a case 
by case basis, but in all cases must be accompanied by a certification from a senior officer from the 
applicant customer.   
For confidential, competitively sensitive information essential to determining whether the project, 
customer,  or  contract  qualifies  for  the  program,  applicants  may  submit  redacted  versions  of 
documents as outlined above.  To be protected from disclosure under the Illinois Freedom of 
Information Act, any such redactions must constitute “[t]rade secrets and commercial or financial 
information . . . where the trade secrets or commercial or financial information are furnished under 
a claim that they are proprietary, privileged, or confidential, and that disclosure of the trade secrets 
or commercial or financial information would cause competitive harm to the person or business.”284 
As the disclosure of basic customer and project information cannot constitute “commercial or 
financial information” which “would cause competitive harm” if disclosed, the IPA will not entertain 
blanket confidentiality claims on the entirety of the application (but may on individual documents 
within an application, where appropriate).  As required under Section 1-120 of the IPA Act, the 
Agency “shall provide adequate protection for confidential and proprietary information furnished, 
delivered, or filed by any person, corporation, or other entity,” as the Agency presently does for 
confidential  and  redacted  documents  that  it  routinely  receives  in  conducing  competitive 
procurement events.   
6.8. Self-Direct Program Opening  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R) requires that the self-direct RPS compliance program “shall take effect in the 
delivery  year  commencing  June  1,  2023.”    The  IPA  understands  this  to  mean  that  customer 
participation will begin as of June 1, 2023, and thus that initial applications are required to be 
received across the months preceding that start date.   
The ICC approved the IPA Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan in July 2022. The IPA 
proposes the following timeline of subsequent required steps for the first year of the self-direct 
program:   
•  Jan 2023: IPA publishes its analysis of self-direct program size, takes stakeholder comments 
•  Feb 1, 2023: IPA publishes final program size  
•  Feb 1, 2023: IPA publishes application forms  
•  Feb 15, 2023-March 15, 2023: Applications for self-direct program received  
•  March 2023: Compliance filing for determining credit rate for upcoming delivery year  
•  March  15,  2023-April  15,  2023:  Applications  reviewed,  program  participation 
determinations made and communicated to both applicants and applicable electric utilities  
•  June 1, 2023:  First program year commences  
•  March 2024:  Compliance filing for determining credit rate for next delivery year    
•  May 31, 2024:  Conclusion of first program year  
•  July 30, 2024: Deadline for first program year compliance reports

As outlined above, the IPA is tentatively planning to provide its compliance filing in March 2023 for 
establishing a credit rate for the 2023 delivery year.   
6.9. Compliance Reporting   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(3) provides that participating self-direct customers “shall file an annual 
compliance report with the Agency pursuant to terms established by the Agency through its long-
term renewable resources procurement plan to be eligible for participation in this program.”  The 
self-direct customers participating in the program will be required to file an annual compliance 
report within 60 days after the conclusion of each delivery year of the program with the Agency in 
order to remain eligible.  This compliance report will provide updated information including: 
1.  The actual number of RECs retired in connection with the program for the self-direct customer 
over that delivery year; 
2.  Documented proof that the RECs supplied to the program were retired; 
3.  The actual energy usage at the facilities participating in the program during the previous year, 
based on the accounts of participating customers; 
4.  The total energy or RECs supplied to the self-direct customer by the renewable resource facilities 
under the self-direct customer’s relevant contract(s) for the previous year; and 
5.  Any modifications or amendments to the contracts with renewable resource facilities.   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(6) provides that “[i]f a customer receives the self-direct credit but fails to 
properly procure and retire renewable energy credits as required under this subparagraph (R), the 
Commission, on petition from the Agency and after notice and hearing, may direct such customer's 
utility to recover the cost of the wrongfully received self-direct credits plus interest through an adder 
to charges assessed pursuant to Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act.”  Should a customer fail to 
submit  its  required  annual  compliance  report,  or  should  that  annual  compliance  report  not 
demonstrate compliance with program requirements, the IPA may petition the Commission to claw 
back wrongfully received self-direct credits from the non-compliant entity.  Additionally, as also 
envisioned under Section 1-75(c)(1)(R)(6), the Agency may bar such entities from continued 
participation in the program.   
All RECs qualifying for the program must be retired by or on behalf of the self-direct customer as 
verified by the appropriate REC tracking system, either PJM Generation Attribute Tracking System 
(PJM-GATS) or the Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System (M-RETS).   
As the first annual compliance reports will not be required to be filed with the Agency until the

7. Adjustable Block Program 
7.1. Background 
Sections 1-75(c)(1)(K) and (L) of the IPA Act, as established by Public Act 99-0906 (effective June 1, 
2017), required the Agency to establish an Adjustable Block Program for the procurement of RECs 
from new photovoltaic distributed generation systems and from new photovoltaic community 
renewable generation projects (colloquially known as “community solar”). The Adjustable Block 
Program stands in contrast to the competitive procurements described in Chapter 5, in that the 
Program features administratively determined prices for RECs and with enrollment on an ongoing 
basis, rather than featuring discrete procurement events with competitively set, pay-as-bid prices. 
Prior to the adoption of the Adjustable Block Program model, the development of new photovoltaic 
distributed generation in Illinois had been supported in other ways. From 1999 to 2015, the 
Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (“DCEO”) offered rebates for photovoltaic 
projects; these rebates covered up to 25%-30% of the project cost and supported over 1,100 solar 
PV projects with a total capacity of 13 MW.285  The DCEO rebates were available once per year and 
the available budget was quickly allocated, leading to uncertainty for installers about whether their 
projects would or would not receive a rebate in any given year. No funds have been appropriated for 
the rebate program in recent years. 
Additionally, the IPA conducted Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurements in 2015 and 2016 under 
authority granted by Section 1-56(i) of the IPA Act, and the Agency proposed and conducted 
Distributed Generation procurements for the utilities from 2015 through 2017 (although these 
procurements for the utilities were not limited to photovoltaic systems or to new systems) to meet a 
statutory  DG  procurement  target  in  the  pre-P.A.  99-0906  RPS.  The  previous  procurements 
administered by the IPA featured competitive bidding for projects, and each winning bidder received 
a contract through which RECs delivered were paid for at the bidder’s bid price. While this approach 
created the market efficiency inherent in competitive bidding processes, installers of projects found 
it difficult to sell projects when the potential REC revenue would not be known until a bid was 
accepted (or alternatively there would be no REC revenue if a bid was not accepted). To mitigate that 
challenge, the Agency allowed bidders to bid on forecasted blocks of RECs for systems below 25 kW 
and give developers time to identify projects using a known REC price.  
7.1.1.  Future Energy Jobs Act 
The Adjustable Block Program, as created by Public Act 99-0906 (colloquially known as the Future 
Energy Jobs Act), was developed with the intent to address the issues inherent in the previous ways 
that Illinois supported the development of new photovoltaic distributed generation.  
In developing the structure of the Adjustable Block Program, the Agency considered its review of the 
experiences of other jurisdictions (including relevant experiences from Germany, Spain, California, 
and particularly Massachusetts and New York286), what it learned from previous procurements it has 
administered, and the feedback it received from stakeholders. For issues that are not expressly

addressed in the Act, the Agency made decisions regarding implementation that it believed would 
result in a cost effective and successful program, with those decisions then vetted through the 
Commission’s Plan approval process in Docket Nos. 17-0838 and 19-0995.  In some cases, opposing 
or variant positions taken by other litigants were ultimately agreed to by the Agency or otherwise 
adopted in the Commission’s orders approving the Initial and Revised Long Term-Plans. 
As initially designed, the Adjustable Block Program featured an approach that was open on an 
ongoing basis, rather than relying on specific procurement events (or rebate application windows). 
Participation in the program took place through entities called Approved Vendors, who submit 
project applications on behalf of program participants.  Under P.A. 99-0906, the program also 
accommodated community solar project applications, so that homes and businesses that cannot 
place solar on their property can nonetheless participate in, and benefit from, direct access to 
renewable energy.  
The  latest  program  expansion,  pursuant  to  Public  Act  102-0662,  also  includes  new  program 
categories for community-driven community solar projects, public school projects, and projects 
developed by equity eligible contractors; each of these will be discussed in depth in later sections of 
this Chapter.  The shift to an annual block structure, through which blocks open annually at a set price 
rather than with a new block opening upon capacity being filled, likewise constitutes a significant 
shift.  In addition, entities participating in the Adjustable Block Program will need to comply with the 
provisions of the Equity Accountability System described in Chapter 10 starting with project 
applications on or after June 1, 2023.  
The program initially opened in January 2019. Community solar blocks were quickly filled after 
program opening.   Additionally, both the Small and Large distributed generation blocks were filled 
by December 2020. Funding limitations existing from December 2020 until the adoption of Public 
Act 102-0662 in September 2021 created long waitlists for distributed generation and community 
solar projects.  However, the passage of Public Act 102-0662 provided sufficient funding for new 
project application support and required opening of new blocks by December 14, 2021. Those blocks 
closed June 30, 2022, and new blocks subject to this Plan will open in Fall 2022 as discussed below.  
7.1.2.  2021 Program Status and Lessons Learned 
The Agency published a draft Second Revised Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan in 
August 2021, which featured significant discussion of the funding limitations existent at the time.  
Subsequently, the enactment of Public Act 102-0662, also known as the Climate and Equitable Jobs 
Act (colloquially known as “CEJA”), provided a resolution of the funding issue in addition to many 
other changes outlined in Chapter 2, and the Agency withdrew the draft Plan in accordance with 
direction provided through Section 1-75(c)(1)(A) of the IPA Act.  Changes to the IPA Act under P.A. 
102-0662 required the Agency to publish a draft 2022 Long-Term Plan within 120 days of its 
passage.287  In addition to alleviating the funding limitations for the RPS, P.A. 102-0662 added new 
requirements for the program discussed in later sections of this Chapter. 
The funding and capacity made available by Public Act 102-0662 will allow the Agency to continue 
developing and improving the Adjustable Block Program. The Agency has also updated the program 
by drawing from knowledge gained from its successes and challenges to date.

There were several challenges specific to the program’s Community Solar category under P.A. 99-
0906. At program opening, interest from Approved Vendors in the category was high and outpaced 
the capacity available for this project type. As a result, the community solar blocks did not remain 
open and did not go through a declining block progression as planned. After capacity was awarded 
through a lottery process, remaining community solar project applications (and any new applications 
submitted) were placed on lengthy waitlists. Additionally, the community solar projects that were 
developed through this block category lacked diversity – projects tended to be similarly large (2 MW), 
agrarian, and transactional rather than the community-based, diverse projects that may hoped and 
expected to see.  
The Adjustable Block Program overall faced a challenge in the form of the lack of RPS funding across 
2020 and 2021, which stemmed in part from the inability to roll over RPS collections under Section 
16-108(k) of the PUA, and was compounded by energization delays attributed to the COVID-19 global 
pandemic. Absent sufficient funds, the program could not open additional blocks of capacity to serve 
the market and support additional projects without a legislative fix.  
Despite these challenges, the Adjustable Block Program has been successful overall, leading to the 
energized or planned development of over 670 MW of new solar generation in Illinois thus far. The 
Adjustable Block Program REC targets defined in Public Act 99-0906 for the end of the 2020 delivery 
year – 1,000,000 RECs delivered annually from Adjustable Block Program projects – were fully met 
through REC contracts, and the projects built as a result of participation in the program are generally 
geographically diverse, with projects spread across the state. Additionally, there are over 200288 
Approved Vendors available to support Illinois residents and businesses develop solar and subscribe 
to community solar projects through the program.  
7.1.3.  Overview of Public Act 102-0662 Modifications 
With Public Act 102-0662 taking effect on September 15, 2021, the Adjustable Block Program will 
undergo sweeping changes, necessitating updates to program requirements (with much of that 
process already having begun). One of the primary changes will be to the program’s scale resulting 
from budget changes to the Renewable Portfolio Standard, which is discussed in depth in Chapter 3. 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) of the IPA Act targets approximately 12,375,000 RECs delivered annually to be 
procured from new Adjustable Block Program projects by 2030, necessitating perhaps up to 7000 
megawatts of new distributed generation and community solar capacity.  
Other key statutory or administrative updates to the program include, but are not limited to: 
•  Changes to the sizes applicable to Small and Large Distributed Generation categories and to 
the size threshold applicable to Large DG and community solar projects  
•  New program categories for projects located at public schools, community-driven community 
solar projects, and projects from Equity Eligible Contractors 
•  New block capacity allocations 
•  Updated REC prices 
•  Prevailing wage requirements for non-exempted projects 
 
288 Though the Adjustable Block Program has 417 Approved Vendors, the number of actively participating is fewer.

•  Changes to contract payment terms, including a pay-upon-delivery structure for certain 
categories  
•  Updated REC Delivery Contracts 
•  Compliance with the Equity Accountability System 
Each of these changes will be discussed in depth later in this Chapter.  
7.1.4.  Adjustable Block Program Reopening 
Notwithstanding the changes to the Adjustable Block Program implemented through the 2022 Long-
Term Plan, P.A. 102-0662 required the Agency to open blocks of capacity for the program within 90 
days  of  enactment,  by  December  14,  2021.289  This  included  category-specific  requirements 
applicable  to  the  selection  of  waitlisted  traditional  community  solar  projects  as  well  as  the 
establishment of blocks for the newly established categories of public school projects, community-
driven community solar, and equity eligible contractor projects. Among other program updates, REC 
prices  were updated,  block sizes  were  determined,  and  processes  related  to  prevailing  wage 
compliance were established.  
To  develop  updated  program  requirements  and  application  processes,  the  Agency  requested 
extensive  stakeholder  feedback  and  sought  to  incorporate  that  feedback  into  reopening 
requirements,  to  the  extent  possible.    Where  applicable,  determinations made as  part  of  the 
December 2021 program reopening have been incorporated into this 2022 Long-Term Plan.  
The available capacity of blocks opened on December 14, 2021 is listed in Table 7-1. This capacity 
includes 75 MW each for Small and Large Distributed Generation as well as adjustments made to 
accommodate distributed generation projects that were on waitlists as of November 2, 2021.290

The block sizes illustrated in Table 7-1 apply only to the December 2021 program opening.  Future 
block sizes are discussed below.  
Since program reopening on December 14, 2021, 9,581 new Part I project applications have been 
submitted in batches to the program across the four of the six total project categories. Information 
on applications received since reopening is listed in Table 7-2.

Project applications received since reopening on December 14, 2021, reflect a market that is still 
adjusting to the myriad of changes brought by P.A. 102-0662.  
For example, the program has received one public school project application during the reopening 
block period. This does not necessarily mean that there has been little interest in the development of 
public schools projects, but rather might indicate that the market is still getting attuned to this new 
project category within the program and project applications are still being developed.  
This same concept can be applied to the Equity Eligible Contractor block of capacity as well. As EEC 
is a completely new concept in the program, and requires an additional certification process prior to 
application submittal, the lack of project applications submitted since reopening for the EEC block of 
capacity likely can be attributed to market adjustment to new priorities and requirements rather 
than lack of interest. In early March, the Program Administrator received the first application for 
Approved Vendors to register as EECs, which is the predicate step before submitting applications 
into this category.  As of the date of the filing of this Final Plan, there are three approved EEC 
Approved Vendors, while three additional EEC applications are pending approval with the Program 
Administrator. 
Applications for Traditional Community Solar were not immediately received by the program upon 
reopening.  Rather,  Community  Driven  Community  Solar  applications  have  a  distinct  project 
application window and a subsequent project selection process, so there was no reason for an 
Approved Vendor to submit an application at the start of an application window as it would be 
treated equally to a project submitted on the last day of an application window. Applications received 
in this category came in just prior to the closing of that application window on June 12, 2022. This 
category is also completely new to the market, so tuning to these new requirements is likely still 
taking place amongst project developers.  
Lastly, Small DG and Large DG applications submitted to the program since reopening have come in 
at a steady rate showing that the project categories that have been long-standing since the inception 
of the program continue to have a healthy demand.  
 
291 Traditional Community Solar did not receive any new applications; instead, pursuant to Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iv)(3) of the IPA Act, 
reopening capacity was used to accommodate community solar projects that had previously applied to the program and were placed on 
waitlists after the 2019 lottery.

All said, while many aspects of the Adjustable Block Program are brand new to project developers, 
the time between reopening in December of 2021 and the filing of this 2022 Long-Term Plan took 
place across months that experience winter weather in Illinois, which further inhibits ease of project 
development.  
The Agency expects to see an uptick in applications submitted to the program as the weather warms 
and the market recalibrates to changes brought by P.A. 102-0662. The current status of program 
capacity can be found at: https://illinoisabp.com/block-capacity-dashboard/.  
7.2. Program Administrator 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(M) of the Act authorizes the Agency to “retain one or more experts or expert 
consulting firms to develop, administer, implement, operate, and evaluate the Adjustable Block 
program.” The Program Administrator selection process is expressly exempted from the Illinois 
Procurement Code.292  The Agency issued a Request for Qualifications to start the process of selecting 
a Program Administrator for the Adjustable Block Program on January 18, 2018.  The Request for 
Qualifications was a means to identify qualified bidders who were then invited to respond to a 
Request for Proposals.293 Responses to the Request for Proposals were received on April 13, 2018.294  
After the evaluation of received proposals  and consultation with the Staff of the Illinois Commerce 
Commission, the Agency selected InClime, Inc. (“InClime”) to serve as the Program Administrator for 
the Adjustable Block Program.  The Illinois Commerce Commission formally approved the execution 
of a contract between the IPA and InClime at its July 12, 2018 Regular Open Meeting.   
On July 21, 2021, the Agency issued a new Request for Qualifications for a Program Administrator for 
the Adjustable Block Program.295 This Request for Qualifications was issued in anticipation of 
legislation that would update and expand the Adjustable Block Program as subsequently occurred 
with the enactment of Public Act 102-0662 on September 15, 2021. The Agency then issued a Request 
for Proposals to the three qualified respondents to the Request for Proposals on October 25, 2021, 
with responses due on December 20, 2021.  After the review, evaluation, and scoring of proposals, 
and consultation with the Staff of the Illinois Commerce Commission, the IPA selected Energy 
Solutions, Inc. (“Energy Solutions”) to serve as the next Program Administrator for the Adjustable 
Block Program.  The Commission formally approved the execution of a contract between the Agency 
and Energy Solutions on April 21, 2022.  Energy Solutions began the process of preparing for the 
transition  to  the  Program  Administrator  thereafter;  InClime’s  contract  to  serve  as  Program 
Administrator ended on June 30, 2022.The Program Administrator runs the day-to-day operations 
of the Adjustable Block Program. This includes, but is not limited to: 
•  Assisting the Agency with Approved Vendor and Designee registration and training 
•  Developing program requirements via the Program Guidebook, Marketing Guidelines, and 
other programmatic materials  
 
292 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(C)(1)(M). 
293 This process generally follows the process contained in Section 1-75(a)(1)-(5) that the Agency has used to select its Procurement 
Administrator and Procurement Planning Consultant. 
294 The Agency also issued a separate Request for Qualifications/Request for Proposals for a dedicated Program Administrator or 
Administrators for the Illinois Solar for All Program.

(including providing technical support to Approved Vendors and Designees) and collecting 
application fees 
•  Maintaining an online dashboard to show status of block capacity 
•  Reviewing and approving submitted projects 
•  Preparing contracts for Commission review and utility execution 
•  Ongoing monitoring of project development status 
•  Verifying completion of projects and the processing of approvals for payments, as well as 
conducting on-site inspections for quality assurance purposes 
•  Reviewing Annual Reports submitted by Approved Vendors 
•  Providing information for the public including developing a Program brand, and maintaining

•  Verifying compliance with prevailing wage requirements where applicable  
•  Implementing  and  enforcing  the  Program’s  consumer  protection  requirements,  and 
providing assistance to Illinois residents and businesses through the Program’s consumer 
complaint center. 
For this 2022 Long-Term Plan, the Agency is proposing to expand the Program Administrator’s role 
by establishing a mentorship/training program for new Approved Vendors and Designees that are 
minority-owned, woman-owned, veteran-owned, disability-owned or considered a small business 
with the goal to help those new program participants learn about program requirements and 
application procedures. This mentorship and training program will also be available to all Equity 
Eligible Contractors participating in the Program.296 The Program Administrator will assign a 
dedicated  staff  person  to  each  new  Approved  Vendor  or  Designee  who  qualifies  for  this 
mentorship/training program to provide them technical assistance and provide introductions and 
connections to established entities.  
The Program Administrator is authorized to charge fees to Approved Vendors for processing 
applications, as described in Section 7.10.3. The Program Administrator operates under a contract 
with the Agency and may, with approval by the Agency and acquiescence of the utility, also be 
reimbursed directly by the utilities for a portion of the cost of the services provided to them including, 
but not limited to, the preparation of contracts and review of Annual Reports.  
Program Administrator costs, other than those covered by fees collected directly by the Program 
Administrator from Approved Vendors, are considered part of the administrative costs discussed in 
Chapter 3.  The Program Administrator may not be an Approved Vendor. 
7.3. Block Structure 
7.3.1.  Background – Initial Program Design, Declining Price Blocks based on 
Capacity  
The core of the Adjustable Block Program is the concept of a “block.” Prior to the passage of Public 
Act 102-0662, the program delineated incentives for various categories of eligible projects using 
 
296 See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022, at 71.

157,165,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
blocks of generation capacity at certain prices per REC levels.  The blocks were intended to create a 
progression from one price level to another based on the response of the market.  A strong response 
from the market results in a rapid progression to a lower price level, for example, while a weak 
response could elicit an increase in incentives if determined to be necessary. As discussed further 
below, Public Act 102-0662 changed this from a model utilizing declining blocks based on capacity 
and market response to a model utilizing of annual blocks of capacity. 
In the initial phase of the Adjustable Block Program, progression from one level (or “block”) to 
another  was  triggered  by  a  certain  volume  of  proposed  capacity  through  approved  project 
applications, not by a time-based deadline.  This deployment-based design was intended to act as a 
safety valve in case incentives were set at too high a level, which had been a problem in previous 
attempts at administratively determined prices, as incentive levels would step down automatically 
across blocks where participation was highest.  The design can also provide long-term certainty by 
giving an indication of future prices and quantities to all potential market participants. 
The original target for the Adjustable Block Program under P.A. 99-0906 was for 1,000,000 RECs 
delivered annually by the end of the 2020-2021 delivery year (i.e., May 31, 2021).297  Using a capacity 
factor of 17%,298 this calculation resulted in approximately 666 MW of new photovoltaic generation 
to be allocated across program categories and blocks. This amount was not intended to be a cap; if 
funding were available, there would have been no barrier to going beyond that level. However, as has 
been discussed previously in this Chapter, funding constraints prevented the opening of additional 
blocks until the passage of Public Act 102-0662.  
In order to achieve 1,000,000 RECs delivered annually by May 31, 2021, the Initial Long-Term Plan 
featured a block structure that allocated three blocks per category to meet the (then-effective) 
statutory target for this program (i.e., 1 million RECs per year by the end of the 2020-2021 delivery 
year) and included a provision to allocate discretionary capacity (as discussed below) to categories 
through the opening of a Block 4 for each category determined to warrant additional capacity.  
To  encourage  simplicity,  the  Agency  allocated  incentives  into  two  groups  by  service 
territory/geographic category, based upon utility load forecasts.299  
•  Group A: for projects located in the service territories of Ameren Illinois, MidAmerican, Mt. 
Carmel Public Utility, and rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities located in MISO.   
•  Group  B:  for  projects  located  in  the  service  territories  of  ComEd,  and  rural  electric 
cooperatives and municipal utilities located in PJM. 
Incentive levels, expressed through REC prices, varied by group and were based upon the project’s 
group and size. While the Program Administrator attempted to allocate REC delivery contracts with 
the electric utility in whose service territory the project was located (where applicable, as the IPA 
lacks  authority  to  procure  REC  contracts  on  behalf  of  municipal  utilities  or  rural  electric 
 
297 See Chapter 3 of the Agency’s Initial Long-Term Plan for more discussion of this requirement. 
298 This figure used in the Initial Plan was an assumed first-year capacity factor (relative to AC-rated nameplate capacity) for a fixed-mount 
photovoltaic system prior to any degradation over time. 
299 Using this methodology, the combined allocation for Ameren Illinois and MidAmerican would have been 28.53% and the allocation for 
ComEd would have been 71.47%. For simplicity, these were rounded to 30% and 70% for determining the size of blocks for Group A and 
Group B, respectively.

cooperatives),  in  order  to  allocate  RECs  proportionately  among  Ameren  Illinois,  ComEd,  and 
MidAmerican to meet their RPS obligations, that was not always possible.  
In developing the Initial Plan, the Agency also considered creating an additional group or groups for 
MidAmerican, Mt. Carmel Public Utility, rural electric cooperatives, and municipal utilities. However, 
given their small share of the load in Illinois, the resulting group or groups would have been quite 
small. By consolidating them into the larger groups, block sizes became more administratively 
manageable, and prices became more transparent and easily understood. The assignment to Groups 
of projects in the service territories of Mt. Carmel Public Utility, MidAmerican, and rural electric 
cooperatives and municipal utilities was intended to approximately match those smaller entities to 
a larger utility with comparable electric rates. 
Within each group, the blocks were divided by the allocations specified in Section 1-75(c)(1)(K) of 
the IPA Act as established by Public Act 99-0906 (and since modified through P.A. 102-0662, as 
described further in Section 7.3.2):  
•  25% for systems up to 10 kW   
•  25% for systems greater than 10 kW and up to 2,000 kW 
•  25% for photovoltaic community renewable generation; and  
•  25% to be allocated by the Agency.  
Consistent with the Commission’s Order in Docket No. 17-0838, the 25% left to the Agency’s 
discretion was be held in reserve, with a reduction in the originally proposed size of Block 3 used to 
account for that reduced capacity.300 The Agency subsequently allocated that 25% of capacity to 
create new Block 4s for certain categories on April 3, 2019.301 
7.3.2.  Transition to Annual Blocks 
As described above, in the Initial Long-Term Plan, the Agency developed a block structure designed 
to procure 1 million RECs delivered annually from distributed generation and community solar 
projects, with the goal that those blocks would cover approximately a three-year period of program 
activity (i.e., from initial program opening to 2021 delivery year targets). This block structure utilized 
a standard capacity factor (17%) to translate REC goals into MWs of capacity.  As outlined above, the 
Agency allocated 30% of capacity to Group A and 70% to Group B to be in proportion to the loads of 
customers in each area.   
The enactment of Public Act 102-0662 corrects the funding constraints that prevented the opening 
of new blocks of capacity while also creating new ABP categories and allocations. For this Long-Term 
Plan, the Agency has considered how to update the block structure of the ABP to conform with those 
new requirements.  In particular, Section 1-75(c)(1)(K) now eliminates the step-laddered approach 
to block opening in favor of an annual block approach: “for each delivery year: a single block of 
nameplate capacity, a price for renewable energy credits within that block, and the terms and 
 
300 See Docket No. 17-0838, Final Order dated April 3, 2018 at 60.  That the discretionary capacity is taken only from the third block is 
evident from the Order’s statement that it “adopts the proposal of the Joint Solar Parties to hold 25% of the Adjustable Block Program 
capacity by megawatt in reserve,” as this detail was present in the Joint Solar Parties’ proposal, as well as the Order’s statement that 
capacity would be reserved “as outlined in the IPA’s BOE.”

conditions for securing a spot on a waitlist once the block is fully committed or reserved.”  (emphasis 
added) 
In accordance with this statutorily mandated shift to annual blocks, the Agency proposes to open 
blocks at the start of each delivery year, e.g., on June 1.  This schedule of annual blocks opening on 
June 1 will commence with the 2023-2024 delivery year.  As the approval of this Plan will occur after 
June 1, 2022 for the 2022-2023 delivery year, the Agency initially proposed an opening date of August 
1 for the 2022-2023 delivery year as discussed further in Section 7.3.4.  Through the approval of this 
Plan in Docket No. 22-0231, the Agency modified that proposal, recommending a shift in the opening 
date to no earlier than September 1 for the 2022-2023 delivery year.  The Commission approved the 
IPA’s modified proposal to open the 2022-2023 delivery year no earlier than September 1 through 
its Final Order in that proceeding.302  This schedule for block opening is reflected in the table below.

Please note that annual blocks will open on June 1 for all subsequent delivery years following the 2023-
2024 delivery year. 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iv) specified block sizes for the initial reopening of the ABP that occurred on 
December 14, 2021. But for blocks to open after this Plan is approved by the ICC, different 
considerations apply.  The primary consideration is the overall REC target of the RPS, and the portion 
of that whole to be derived from the ABP – as outlined above, over 12 million RECs delivered annually 
are expected to be procured through the Program by 2030.   From there, blocks can be sized based 
on annual procurement quantities in a manner consistent with the category-specific percentages and 
process outlined in subsections (i)-(vii) of Section 1-75(c)(1)(K) of the IPA Act. 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(C) requires the procurement of “45,000,000 renewable energy credits delivered 
annually from new wind and solar projects by the end of delivery year 2030.” Of that 45 million RECs, 
55% is to be sourced from new photovoltaic projects; 50% of that 55% (or 27.5% overall) from the 
Adjustable Block Program.  This creates a 2030 target 12.375 million RECs from the Adjustable Block 
Program. Approximately 1 million RECs have already been procured through the program activity 
from 2019 through 2021, and another 990,000 RECs are expected to be procured from the blocks of 
capacity opened in December of 2021. This leaves a little over 10 million RECs to be procured over 
the next eight years.  
For the two delivery years covered by this Long-Term Plan (2022-2023 and 2023-2024) the Agency 
proposes a goal of procuring approximately 1 million RECs annually – with the expectation that 
quantities can grow in subsequent delivery years as the solar industry in Illinois continue to grow.  
These can then be broken down into block sizes for individual categories based on the percentage-
based allocation made through Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(i)-(vi) of the IPA Act.  For simplicity, the Agency 
will continue to use a 17% capacity factor for translating REC targets to MW sizes.  Block sizes have

been rounded to the closest megawatt and will continue to use the 30/70% split between Groups A 
and B.  
All categories feature capacity allocations proportionate to the percentage-based allocations outlined 
in Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(i)-(vi) of the IPA Act with the exception of the Traditional Community Solar 
project category.  For that category, presumably due to the 250 MW initial allocation to waitlisted 
projects upon P.A. 102-0662’s passage, Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(iii) of the Act states that “[c]apacity for 
this category for the first 2 delivery years . . . shall be allocated to waitlist projects,” with block opening 
occurring “[s]tarting in the third delivery year . . . or earlier if the Agency determines there is 
additional capacity needed for to meet previous delivery year requirements.”  Given the additional 
allocations to the Small DG and Large DG project categories upon reopening and the desire for 
proportionate allocations between categories, the potential for attrition from previously awarded 
contracts and reopening capacity, and the desire to avoid an additional year’s worth of project 
applications building up across 2022-23 (resulting in a potentially massive waitlist of project 
applications once again), the Agency has determined that additional capacity is needed to meet 
previous delivery year requirements and that opening the traditional community solar before June 
1, 2023 is indeed warranted.   
The IPA plans to open the traditional community solar block for project applications on November 1, 
2022, at a size consistent with an allocation for the second delivery year that leaves community solar 
capacity roughly on pace with allocations made to the Small DG and Large DG categories.  As the 
Program Year 1 support for Small DG and Large DG was approximately 140 MW per category, and 
Program Year 2 has those categories being supported at 134 MW per category, that results in 
approximately 274 MW per DG category across the first two program years after P.A. 102-0662’s 
passage.  As Traditional Community Solar is 30% of the ABP and each DG category is 20% of the ABP, 
additional support beyond the Traditional Community Solar category’s initial 250 MW allocation for 
two years is required.   To maintain consistency with this 30% vs. 20% ratio, the Agency believes an 
additional 160 MW should be allocated to Traditional Community Solar for Program Year 2 to meet 
previous delivery year requirements, thus resulting in 410 MW total across the first two program 
years.    
As Section 1-75(c)(1)(K) requires that “the waitlist of projects in a given year will carry over to apply 
to the subsequent year when another block is opened,” this second program year opening will 
hopefully allow for the establishment of an ordinal waitlist to support the third program year’s 
traditional community solar block opening without a “gold rush” in the Spring of 2023.   
Table 7-4 lists the proposed block sizes for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 delivery years.

The total of these blocks sizes, in combination with prior waitlist allocations in the case of traditional 
community solar, creates a program capacity on an annual basis equivalent to capacity that the 
Agency had proposed for the first three years of the Adjustable Block Program back in 2018, which 
ended up being fully allocated in approximately two years’ time. This increase in program size will 
allow for the solar industry in Illinois to continue to grow and the Agency expects to propose larger 
block sizes in the next Long-Term Plan scheduled for finalization in 2024 (including an increase in 
the allocation to Equity Eligible Contractor projects as discussed in Section 7.4.6 below).  
7.3.4.  Opening of 2022 Delivery Year Blocks & Subsequent Annual Block 
Openings 
The Agency is faced with a timing challenge for the opening of the 2022-2023 delivery year, given 
that each delivery year is now associated with a single block of capacity for each category. This 
challenge arises due to the fact that this Long-Term Plan is not expected to be approved by the ICC 
until July 19, 2022, while the 2022-2023 delivery year begins June 1, 2022.  The Agency initially 
proposed to address this timing challenge through a pause of project applications beginning on June 
1, 2022 and extending through August 1, 2022.  During the litigation of this Plan before the 
 
303 These totals are preliminary amounts unadjusted for an unallocated capacity from prior program years.  The final allocation for the 
2022-2023 delivery year will be outlined in the next iteration of the ABP Program Guidebook published in accordance with this Final 
Plan. 
304 At the time of publication of this Plan, the calculation of uncontracted capacity for Program year 2021-22 was not yet complete. Per 
Section 7.3.5 of this Plan, block sizes for the 2022-23 Program year will increase slightly based on reallocation of uncontracted capacity.

162,170,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Commission, the IPA proposed to shift that application pause period back one month, to begin on 
June 30, 2022 and extend through August 31, 2022.305  The Commission found this proposal to be 
reasonable and approved the modified timeline in its Final Order approving this Plan.306   
The Agency will begin to accept applications for all categories except traditional community solar on 
September 1, 2022, with the caveat that date may need to be postponed if there are significant 
unexpected implementation issues arising from the ICC’s approval of this Plan.  As explained in 
Section 7.3 above and further in Section 7.4.3 below, the Agency will begin to accept applications for 
the Traditional Community Solar category on November 1, 2022.  
This timing challenge arises only in the context of opening annual blocks for the 2022-2023 delivery 
year; beginning with the 2023 delivery year and for all subsequent delivery years, the Agency would 
open all blocks of capacity on June 1. This schedule is reflected in Table 7-3 in Section 7.3.2. 
7.3.5.  Uncontracted Capacity at the Close of a Delivery Year 
As the program shifts to a schedule of annual blocks of capacity and away from a structure where 
blocks remain open until block capacity is exhausted, unused or uncontracted capacity could remain 
at the close of a delivery year. Changes to the IPA Act made through P.A. 102-0662 now requires that 
“uncontracted capacity” to be “redistribute[d]” to “one or more other categories.”  
In relevant part, Section 1-75(c)(1)(K) of the Act now states: 
“To the extent there is uncontracted capacity from any block in any of categories (i) through 
(vi) at the end of a delivery year, the Agency shall redistribute that capacity to one or more 
other categories giving priority to categories with projects on a waitlist. The redistributed 
capacity shall be added to the annual capacity in the subsequent delivery year, and the price 
for renewable energy credits shall be the price for the new delivery year. Redistributed 
capacity shall not be considered redistributed when determining whether the goals in this 
subsection (K) have been met.” 
This language raises questions about a) by when an “uncontracted capacity” determination would be 
made  and  b)  how  redistribution  prioritization  across  “one  or  more  other  categories”  with 
prioritization “to categories with projects on a waitlist” will be applied.    The Agency’s approach will 
preserve capacity in the new categories of the Adjustable Block Program as those categories develop, 
and will preserve capacity in the Equity Eligible Contractor category.  The following approach to the 
redistribution of excess capacity was developed through the approval of the Plan in ICC Docket No. 
22-0231 and approved by the Commission through its Final Order in that proceeding.307    
All capacity in the new Public Schools and Community-Driven Community Solar categories that 
remains uncontracted from the blocks opened on December 14, 2021 will be rolled over within that 
same category to the 2022-2023 delivery year.  At the end of the 2022-2023 delivery year, if 
uncontracted capacity remains in the Public Schools and Community-Driven Community Solar 
categories, 50% of that capacity will rollover into the capacity allocation for the 2023-2024 delivery 
year, while the other 50% will be allocated in accordance with the process outlined below.

163,171,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
The Agency will determine the amount of uncontracted capacity across all program categories (with 
the caveat related to the Public Schools and Community-Driven Community Solar categories for the 
2022-2023 and 2023-2024 delivery years outlined above, and preserving Equity Eligible Contractor 
capacity generally) within one week after the closing date of that year’s annual blocks.  That 
uncontracted capacity will be summed to a total amount, with distribution of that total amount made 
according to the prioritization below.   
•  The Agency will first allocate any uncontracted capacity to the Equity Eligible Contractors 
category to select waitlisted projects from this category.  
o  As the only category which is expressly sought to be expanded over time, growing to 
40% of the ABP by 2030, this approach allows the Agency to expand capacity 
allocated to the EEC category should demand allow.  In addition, as P.A. 102-0662 
prioritizes the diversification of the Illinois clean energy economy and instructs the 
Agency to provide better and broader access to Equity Eligible Contractors through 
its solar programs, this approach best meets the spirit of the law.  
o  If there is unallocated capacity in the Equity Eligible Contractor category, that 
capacity will not be reallocated to other categories.  If substantial unused capacity 
remains within this category, the IPA will work with stakeholders to identify barriers 
to participation in this category and develop plans to mitigate those barriers  
•  Next, the Agency will prioritize reallocation of any remaining uncontracted program capacity 
to the Small Distributed Generation category to select waitlisted projects from this category.  
o  This approach helps maximize the number of Illinois residents and/or businesses 
that can benefit from the Adjustable Block Program.   
•  Next, the Agency will prioritize reallocation of any still remaining uncontracted program 
capacity to the Community-Driven Community Solar category if a waitlist of Community-
Driven Community Solar projects has formed.  Eligible waitlisted projects will be selected by 
scoring rank order (which establishes the ordinal waitlist for that category) and will be 
required to have met the minimum scoring threshold for selection.   
o  This category is prioritized in recognition of the concern that community solar project 
development in Illinois has been largely homogenous since program inception. This 
new program category was established to diversify the community solar market 
through community-driven projects, and allocating waitlisted capacity maximizes its 
impact. 
•  If  uncontracted  capacity  remains  after  prioritized  reallocation  to  these three  program 
categories, the Agency will evenly distribute the remaining uncontracted capacity across the 
remaining program categories featuring waitlists.  Should a category’s waitlist be satisfied by 
less capacity than that distribution, then the remaining capacity shall be added to the other 
category or categories featuring waitlists.    
If any or all uncontracted capacity cannot be used to satisfy existing waitlists, then that remaining 
uncontracted  capacity  will  be  distributed  across  all  program  categories  on  a  pro  rata  basis 
corresponding with those categories Section 1-75(c)(1)(K) percentage allocations.   
The Agency will publish its capacity redistribution within one week after determining the sum total 
of capacity (i.e., within two weeks after the close of that year’s annual blocks).  Capacity distribution 
to categories featuring waitlists will result in projects selected off of those waitlists by waitlist order, 
with the resulting contract price at the price of the next annual block.  Published block capacities for

that next annual block will be updated to reflect that category’s expanded, and now-filled, capacity 
additions.     
For waitlisted capacity not met through uncontracted capacity redistribution, Section 1-75(c)(1)(K) 
also provides that “the waitlist of projects in a given year will carry over to apply to the subsequent 
year when another block is opened.”  Thus, those waitlisted projects will be given priority in selection 
within their category under that new delivery year’s capacity allocation to that category.   
7.4. Adjustable Block Program Categories 
Through the enactment of Public Act 102-0662, three new categories (Public Schools, Community-
Driven Community Solar, and Equity Eligible Contractors) were added to the Program’s existing three 
categories (Small Distributed Generation, Large Distributed Generation, and Traditional Community 
Solar). Each project application submitted to the program after the passage of Public Act 102-0662 
will apply to one of these six categories. 
Pursuant to the requirements of P.A. 102-0662, projects in each of these six categories are subject to 
the prevailing wage requirements in the Prevailing Wage Act (820 ILCS 130/et seq.), except as noted 
within the category descriptions below.308  Prevailing wage is a minimum compensation level by 
county set by the Illinois Department of Labor for construction activities related to public works. 
Additionally, Public Act 102-0673, which became effective on November 30, 2021, clarifies that 
projects receiving incentives under the Program are “public works” subject to the Prevailing Wage 
Act —which requires compliance with additional provisions under the Prevailing Wage Act, including 
notice requirements.  
7.4.1.  Small Distributed Generation 
The Small Distributed Generation category includes distributed generation projects up to and 
including 25 kW in size. The Small Distributed Generation category will comprise at least 20% of the 
ABP capacity generally. 
Each project that is constructed in this category will be subject to prevailing wage requirements 
included in the Prevailing Wage Act309 except the following types of projects: 
•  Projects that serve a single-family or multi-family residential building, and 
•  Projects that serve a house of worship and are not greater than 100 kW AC (aggregated with 
any co-located projects) 
•  Projects  for  which  construction  can  be  demonstrated  to  have  been  completed  before 
September 15, 2021, the effective date of Public Act 102-0662. 
7.4.2.  Large Distributed Generation 
The Large Distributed Generation category includes distributed generation projects greater than 25 
kW in size up to and including 5 MW. The Large Distributed Generation category will comprise at 
least 20% of the ABP capacity generally. 
 
308 See 20 ILCS 3855 1-75(c)(1)(Q).

7.4.3.  Traditional Community Solar 
The Traditional Community Solar category310 now allows for community solar projects up to and 
including 5 MW in size (increased from 2 MW).  Capacity for the Traditional Community Solar 
category for the first two years after the effective date of Public Act 102-0662 were allocated to 
projects already on ordinal waitlists as of Public Act 102-0662’s enactment, as outlined below.311  
Traditional Community Solar projects must have subscriptions of 25 kW or less constitute at least 
50% of the facility’s nameplate capacity.  The Traditional Community Solar category will generally 
comprise at least 30% of the ABP capacity. Traditional Community Solar projects will now also 
feature 20-year REC delivery contracts that pay for RECs over time as they are delivered, rather than 
the front-loaded payment schedule previously used for community solar. 
For Traditional Community Solar projects, P.A. 102-0662 allocated 250 MW (30% or 75 MW to Group 
A, and 70% or 175 MW to Group B) of new Adjustable Block Program capacity to Approved Vendors 
(including affiliates) having waitlisted ABP community solar applications in proportion to the 
capacity of their waitlisted applications that meet the following requirements: 1) were eligible for 
the April 10, 2019 lottery, 2) were on the ABP community solar waitlist as of December 31, 2020, and 
3) are currently active (Part I status remains verified).  The Adjustable Block Program Administrator 
reviewed portfolios of projects submitted by the March 14, 2022 deadline through the waitlist 
allocation process published on the Program website.  The Agency allowed Approved Vendors to 
request that projects be held from submission to the Commission for approval in order to determine 
whether a substitution of the project may be necessary under Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iv)(3)(iii) of the 
IPA Act.  The Agency announced the publication of project information for the selected projects on 
April 14, 2022, on the Program website.312 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(iii) provides that “capacity for this category for the first 2 delivery years” shall 
be allocated according to the block reopening process described in Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iv), with 
this category opening for project applications “starting in the third delivery year after the effective 
date” of P.A. 102-0662 “or earlier if the Agency determines there is additional capacity needed for to 
[sic] meet previous delivery year requirements.”  As outlined in Section 7.3 above, the Agency plans 
 
310 “Traditional Community Solar” is used to designate projects described in Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(iii) for clarity to distinguish these 
projects from the newly established Community-Driven Community Solar project category. 
311 As required by Section 1-75(c)(1)(G)(iv)(3) of the IPA Act, for the December 14, 2021 block reopening, project size was still limited to 
2 MW as waitlisted projects were proportionately allocated to Approved Vendors with valid projects that were both on waitlists as of 
December 31, 2020 and originally eligible for the April 2019 community solar project selection process.

166,174,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
to initially open the Traditional Community Solar Category for project applications on November 1, 
2022.  
For Traditional Community Solar blocks that open after the approval of this 2022 Long-Term Plan, 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(iii)(1) specifies that “the Agency shall select projects on a first-come, first-
serve basis, however the Agency may suggest additional methods to prioritize projects that are 
submitted at the same time.”  The Agency proposed, and the Commission affirmed, an approach 
whereby “submitted at the same time” be considered on a first day basis rather than the exact second 
(or nano-second) that a project application is submitted at program opening.  This is intended to 
prevent an unfair advantage to entities that have a faster internet connection while maintaining the 
spirit of the law.   
As the Agency expects that it is likely that applications for Traditional Community Solar projects 
submitted even on the first day of block opening may continue to exceed block capacity, some 
methodology for distinguishing between those projects must be employed.  Noting the distaste that 
market participants have voiced for random selection processes, the Agency proposes to utilize a 
scoring system that prioritizes qualitative aspects of individual projects.  For the sake of clarity, this 
approach maintains the “first-come, first serve basis” outlined in the law, but seeks to score projects 
only if more project applications are received on that “first” day than the Agency has capacity 
available in the program.   
In developing its scoring system, the Agency has, in some cases, attempted to avoid overlap with the 
qualitative  scoring  provided  to  community-driven  community  solar  projects under  Section  1-
75(c)(1)(K)(v); however, the Agency is also mindful of that category demonstrating characteristics 
featuring express support by the General Assembly.  This scoring system focuses on qualitative 
aspects of projects with an eye toward objectives outlined in declaratory paragraphs or other 
statutory language found in the Illinois Power Agency Act.  Additionally, given the repeated advocacy 
by solar industry trade associations (including through comments on the Draft Plan), this scoring 
system also provides additional credit to projects featuring earlier interconnection agreement dates. 
While the IPA is reluctant to decide between competing applications using qualitative criteria (such 
as interconnection agreement effective date timing) that a) has no express support in statute and b) 
does not appear to constitute progress toward an important policy objective, further differentiating 
between  applications  using  transparent  criteria  may  prevent  receiving  many  times  more 
applications than slots available in the program, as potential project applications unable to favorably 
differentiate  themselves  may  never  apply.    Additionally,  basic  principles  of  fairness  support 
providing more favorable treatment to proposed projects that have been under development for a 
longer period of time.    
Thus,  if  applications  on  Day  1  exceed  block  capacity,  as  modified  by  the  Illinois  Commerce 
Commission’s Order in Docket No. 22-0231, the Agency will prioritize project applications utilizing 
the scoring system outlined below.  Certain aspects of the scoring system will be determined through 
a stakeholder comment process conducted subsequent to this Plan’s filing with the Commission, with 
details still being determined as of the date of this filing.   
Projects may receive up to the maximum number of points listed for each of the four sections below. 
A project’s score will sum to the points it receives across all four sections.

umbrella of disturbed lands used in this Plan.  
Mechanically disturbed  -  Land in an altered and often non-vegetated state that, due to disturbances by mechanical means, is in 
transition from one cover type to another. Mechanical disturbances include forest clear-cutting, earthmoving, scraping, chaining, 
reservoir drawdown, and other similar human-induced changes. 
Nonmechanically disturbed  -  Land in an altered and often non-vegetated state that, due to disturbances by nonmechanical 
means, is in transition from one cover type to another. Nonmechanical disturbances are caused by wind, floods, fire, animals, 
and other similar phenomenon.

4.  Interconnection Application Effective Date – Maximum of 4 points permitted 
The Agency initially proposed a scoring process that would award higher points to 
projects with earlier original interconnection dates, giving fractionally different 
points for each.  In approving this Plan, the Commission found that the Agency should 
“encourage”  having  a currently  valid,  executed  interconnection  agreement  as  a 
scoring criterion under this category.319  The Agency will consult with stakeholders 
in  determining  the  appropriate  number  of  points  to  assign  to  this  criterion.  
Additionally, the Agency will consider and discuss with stakeholders the JSP’s two 
additional  interconnection  scoring  criteria,  the  removal  of  the  proposed 
interconnection criteria outlined in the filed Plan, and any other interconnection-
related criteria that the Agency believes warrants consideration.320   
 
The IPA plans to issue a strawman proposal to initiate this stakeholder feedback 
process.  The Agency will review and consider the stakeholder feedback and expects 
to issue a final determination on the scoring award related to interconnection 
agreements/applications prior to the opening of the Traditional Community Solar 
category on November 1, 2022, but subsequent to the finalization and filing of this 
Plan.  Accordingly, the finalized Traditional Community Solar scoring rubric will be 
posted on the Program website and incorporated into the Program Guidebook, but 
cannot be outlined within this Final Plan. 
For a project receiving points under any criteria listed above that includes a commitment, if the 
project  is  selected,  the  resulting  REC  delivery  contract  will  include  a  requirement  that  the 
commitment is met as of the Part II verification, with failure to meet, and maintain, the commitment, 
an event of default that would lead to termination of the contract or product order (and forfeiture of 
associated collateral).  Should the Agency determine that a commitment was not made with a good 
faith intent to comply, the Agency may consider disciplinary action against that Approved Vendor, 
including suspension of the ability to submit future applications.   
After this scoring criteria is applied to the universe of received projects, each project will be given a 
score resulting in a rank, which then results in an ordinal list.  This ordinal list will be used to select 
projects for the delivery year in which the process takes place and will establish the initial project 
waitlist.  Any applications submitted after the first day of annual block opening will be slotted on the 
waitlist behind those project applications received on the first day and prioritized based on time and 
date received and will not be scored.  The resulting ordinal waitlist will be used to select any 
additional projects should capacity become free within that delivery year or should the category 
receive a redistribution of uncontracted capacity as described in Section  7.3.5. As Section 1-
75(c)(1)(K) requires that “the waitlist of projects in a given year will carry over to apply to the 
subsequent year when another block is opened,” projects remaining on the ordinal waitlist after 
 
319 Specifically, the Commission determined that “having a currently valid, executed ICA should be encouraged and included as one of the 
scoring criteria in the IPA’s waitlist scoring system, as the JSPs propose” and directed “to include this scoring criterion within its 
interconnection scoring category” while leaving “the appropriate number of points to assign to this criterion” a decision to be made by 
the IPA “in consultation with stakeholders.”  Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 58.

reallocation of uncontracted capacity as described in Section 7.3.5 will be prioritized for selection in 
the next delivery year.  In approving this approach, the Commission also found that a minimum 
threshold point requirement was necessary to enter the waitlist.321  The Agency will continue 
stakeholder discussions to determine the appropriate numerical threshold—which, as required by 
the Commission’s Order, will be above the number of points awarded to those projects which have a 
currently valid, executed interconnection agreement.  The Agency’s approach will be finalized and 
published in accordance with the stakeholder process outlined above relating to interconnection 
criteria scoring.  
The Agency also proposes the application of a 20% developer cap for any affiliated322 family of project 
developers for this Traditional Community Solar capacity. Any affiliated family of project developers 
which exceeds 20% of the awarded capacity in a given year’s Traditional Community Solar block 
(determined separately for Groups A and B) will have any projects that cause them to exceed the 20% 
capacity cap moved to become the first projects on the waitlist for the applicable group. If multiple 
affiliated entities exceed the 20% cap, then the projects moved to the beginning of the waitlist(s) will 
be ranked by the scores the received, with random selection used to break any ties.  The 20% 
developer cap applicable to one year’s project selections will carry over to subsequent delivery years 
should a given year’s waitlist be utilized for the next year’s project selections. Details on the 
application of the developer cap will be part of the stakeholder process outlined above.323  
If further ordering is required across first-day projects (for instance, ordering of projects featuring 
the same score where projects receiving that score span across selected and unselected capacity 
within that block), the Agency proposes only then to utilize a random selection process to create a 
rank-order within those equivalently-scored projects.  This process would only be developed by the 
Agency if/when the need arises based on the block capacity represented by first-day applications 
received and a need to differentiate between equivalently-scored projects.      
The Agency will endeavor to publish the scores and related materials for all participating projects 
after project selection takes place to ensure transparency and inform applicants in future Program 
years.  
The Agency considered the development of scoring criteria for Traditional Community Solar projects 
that included subscriber commitments, including commitments to utilize a certain percentage of local 
subscribers, a certain percentage of small subscribers, and/or a certain percentage of low-income 
subscribers. While these types of requirements may be applicable to Community-Driven Community 
Solar and Low-Income Community Solar participating in the Illinois Solar for All Program, given the 
large scale of the Traditional Community Solar category, challenges exist related to the ongoing 
verification of the subscriber type and level of that subscriber type within the project. The Agency 
has not found a clear path forward that would incorporate these types of commitments and not create 
immense administrative burden as the community solar market continues to grow.

322 “Affiliated” means, with respect to any entity, any other entity that, directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, 
is controlled by, or is under common control with each other or a third entity. “Control” means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the 
power to direct the management and policies of an entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. 
Affiliates may not have shared sales or revenue-sharing arrangements, or common debt and equity financing arrangements. 
323 In approving the Plan, the Commission indicated that “a developer cap, which will also help ensure a fair ranking of the waitlist, is 
appropriate” but may not be “described in sufficient detail by the parties.”  Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 59.

7.4.4.  Public Schools 
The Public Schools category includes Small and Large Distributed Generation projects as well as 
community solar projects that serve a public school in Illinois.324 The Public Schools category will 
generally comprise at least 15% of the ABP capacity.  Public Schools projects will also feature 20-year 
REC delivery contracts that pay for RECs over time as they are delivered, rather than the front-loaded 
payment schedule previously used under the ABP. 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(iv) of the IPA Act restricts the eligibility of projects under the Public Schools 
category to those that are installed “at” a public school.  In accordance with the Commission’s Final 
Order approving this Plan, community solar projects developed on land adjacent to a public school 
or on school district-owned land are eligible to participate in this category.325 
For community solar projects participating in the Public Schools category, the public school at which 
the project is sited (or the school district within which the project host is located) must be an anchor 
subscriber to the community solar project. As such, the public school or district must subscribe to a 
minimum of 10% of the project’s capacity and, by law, cannot exceed 40% of the project’s capacity.  
The Agency recognizes that it may be difficult for a school district or public school to predict the levels 
of student enrollment – and thereby, energy usage – for the next 20 years.  The Agency will allow 
flexibility around the ability of an anchor tenant of a Public School category community solar project 
to transfer the subscription to another public school or school district and adjust the subscription 
size (within the 10-40% range) as needed.  In order to ensure that the benefits of the Public Schools 
category return to the schools that host these community solar projects, the Agency will require that 
the hosting public school (or the district within which the hosting school is located) request a waiver 
from the requirements as necessary during the subscription term.  The Agency will develop the 
waiver process through solicitation of stakeholder feedback and publish the process in the Program 
Guidebook.326  
For this category, public schools are defined as any school operated by the authority of the Illinois 
School Code.327  Public school projects located within Environmental Justice Communities or located 
on schools that are categorized as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 school based on the latest annual Evidence-Based 
Funding Distribution process by the Illinois State Board of Education shall be given priority in the 
allocation process.328 
To achieve the desired prioritization, 70% of capacity will be allocated to schools categorized as Tier 
1, Tier 2, and schools located within Environmental Justice Communities, and 30% will be allocated 
to Tier 3 and Tier 4 schools not located within Environmental Justice Communities. Tiers will be 
determined using the prior year results of the annual Evidence-Based Funding Distribution process 
conducted by the Illinois State Board of Education.329 Capacity will be further allocated by size within 
these two groups of school types. 25% of each allocation will go to projects less than or equal to 250 
 
324 For the December 14, 2021 block opening of capacity for Public Schools, only DG applications were accepted.  
325 See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 62.  The Agency understands that the Commission’s finding that ”school 
districts only exist if there is a school, and as long as the project is located on school district land, then the project is in effect ’installed at’ 
a public school“ would allow a distributed generation project to be installed at/on a school district building as well as at/on a public school.

than 1 MW AC in size.  
For each delivery year, if any of the above allocations are not filled within 180 days, projects located 
at a public school will be accepted on a first come, first serve basis regardless of Tier, Environmental 
Justice Community location, or project size.   
In order to ensure a smooth transition to new requirements in the market, there will be a one-year 
grace period wherein public school projects will be permitted to participate in Illinois Solar for All’s 
Non-Profit and Public Facility sub-program.330 More information on this grace period can be found in 
Chapter 8. Public schools projects that have a pending application in the ILSFA program may not 
submit an application to the Adjustable Block Program. Application and subsequent rejection of said 
application to either program does not prohibit an Approved Vendor from applying to the other 
program after rejection, but rather an Approved Vendor may not have an active application for the 
same project in both programs simultaneously.  
7.4.5.  Community-Driven Community Solar 
The Community-Driven Community Solar (“CDCS”) category includes community solar projects up 
to 5 MW that meet the criteria to be classified as community-driven. The CDCS category will comprise 
at least 5% of the ABP generally and these projects are intended to provide a more direct and tangible 
connection and benefits to the communities in which they operate. 
Each delivery year, the Agency will have a 90-day period for projects to be submitted prior to any 
project selection. After the close of that 90-day period, the Agency will review projects submitted and 
score them according to the project selection process described below. The Agency will endeavor to 
complete the review, scoring, and selection process within 90 days. Projects will be selected in order 
from projects with the highest score to projects with the lowest score based on the below scoring 
mechanism until the capacity for the Community-Driven Community Solar block is filled.  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(v) of the IPA Act, as amended by Public Act 102-0662, provides that the Agency 
shall develop selection criteria for projects participating in this category. Primary selection criteria 
include:  
•  Community ownership or community wealth-building through having a minimum of 50% of 
the ownership of the project held by community residents or non-profit organizations which 
directly serve the community where the project is located. This would include having 
members of the community being able to participate in decisions regarding the governance, 
operation, maintenance, and upgrades of and to the project; and members of that community 
benefiting from the project through subscriptions to the project. 
•  Additional  direct  and  indirect  community  benefits,  beyond  project  participation  as  a 
subscriber, including, but not limited to, economic, environmental, social, cultural, and 
physical benefits. The application must quantify the value of these benefits and they must 
represent at least 20% of the REC contract value. 
 
330 In approving the Plan, the Commission agreed with this proposed limitation on public school participation in the Illinois Solar for All 
Program, but also determined that “if that category is unable to meet demand from public schools and the ILSFA Non-Profit Public Facilities 
sub-program is undersubscribed, the IPA should revisit the issue in its next LTRRPP.”  Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022

o  Direct benefits can include, but are not limited to, financial benefits for the owner(s) 
and subscribers, such as bill savings, revenues from project ownership, tax credits, 
and the financial value of the project, as well as job creation, direct income, and 
increased economic activity in the defined geographic community. 
o  Indirect benefits can include, but are not limited to, demonstration of environmental, 
educational, and cultural benefits.   
•  Meaningful involvement in project organization and development by community members, 
nonprofit organizations, or public entities located in or serving the community. 
o  Meaningful involvement as used herein can mean, but is not limited to, a process that 
consists of public input, participation and engagement in the program design process, 
including workshops, webinars, and public comment periods all of which afford 
stakeholders (those that have an interest or stake in an issue, such as individuals, 
interest groups, and communities) the opportunity to influence decisions that impact 
their community. 
•  Engagement in  project operations and  management  by  nonprofit  organizations,  public 
entities, or community members.  
o  Engagement as used herein can mean, but is not limited to, continuous community 
participation and consultation as projects are built, operated, and maintained in a 
way that affords opportunities for the community to weigh in on and make decisions 
regarding the project. 
•  Whether a project is developed in response to a site-specific RFP developed by community 
members, or a nonprofit organization or public entity located in or serving the community. 
Sufficient demonstration of any of the individual primary selection criteria will be worth up to four 
(4) points each in the scoring system.  
Demonstration of any of these primary selection criteria should be accomplished through a detailed 
written narrative description that includes firm commitments and evidence as to how any benefits, 
resources, and wealth-building will flow to the community that will host the Community-Driven 
Community  Solar  project.  Additionally,  any  community  engagement  activities  and  planned 
community ownership should be documented in a detailed way in this narrative.   
The Agency requested feedback on how to define terms used in the primary selection criteria in the 
request  for  comments  put  forth  prior  to  the  release  of  the  draft  2022  Long-Term  Plan  and 
additionally requested feedback on these terms in the draft 2022 Long-Term Plan itself, but did not 
receive substantive feedback to help focus these terms and/or concepts.  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(v) of the IPA Act, as amended by Public Act 102-0662, also detailed the 
following additional selection criteria to prioritize CDCS projects that:  
•  are developed in collaboration with or to provide complementary opportunities for the Clean 
Jobs Workforce Network Program, the Illinois Climate Works Preapprenticeship Program, 
the Returning Residents Clean Jobs Training Program, the Clean Energy Contractor Incubator 
Program, or the Clean Energy Primes Contractor Accelerator Program  
o  Complementary opportunities as used herein can mean, but is not limited to: utilizing 
graduates of job training programs in project development; hiring job training 
graduates  permanently  for  future  projects,  not  just  the  applicant  project;  an

expansion of the goals of the job training programs to include ‘business training,’ on 
how to develop a project, get financing, recruit customers, etc. 
•  increase the diversity of locations of community solar projects in Illinois, including by 
locating in urban areas and population centers  
•  are located in Equity Investment Eligible Communities 
•  are not greenfield projects 
•  serve only local subscribers331  
•  have a nameplate capacity that does not exceed 500 kW 
•  are developed by an equity eligible contractor; or  
•  otherwise meaningfully advance the goals of providing more direct and tangible connection 
and benefits to the communities which they serve or in which they operate and increasing 
the variety of community solar locations, models, and options in Illinois. 
Sufficient demonstration of any of the individual secondary selection criteria will be worth up to two 
(2) points each in the scoring system.  
Demonstration of any of these additional selection criteria should be accomplished through a 
detailed written narrative description separate from the narrative provided for the primary selection 
criteria outlined directly above.  Evidence of any/all additional selection criteria that are applicable 
to  the  applicant’s  Community-Driven  Community  Solar  project  should  be  outlined  as 
comprehensively as possible in this narrative.   
Selection of projects will be based on total points awarded up to the category’s block size.  To avoid 
prioritization of a project that does not have community-based support, the Agency will require a 
minimum score of six (6) points for project category qualification. Random selection would only be 
utilized as a tie-breaker for equally scored projects to fill available capacity, if any; however, should 
the capacity available be so small so as to only accommodate one or more projects below a certain 
size, then the Agency might only consider those projects small enough to not exceed that remaining 
capacity. 
After project selection for any given delivery year is complete, projects that were not selected and 
that have a minimum score of at least ten points will be placed on a waitlist for the following delivery 
year. The increase in the minimum score requirement is to ensure the quality of projects carried over 
from year to year. 
The Agency recognizes that as Community-Driven Community Solar is a new type of community solar 
for Illinois and introduces a variety of new ways of evaluating project types, the first few years of the 
category should be viewed as an opportunity to learn how communities choose to organize and 
develop projects. Only after several rounds of project selection will it be possible to evaluate if the 
approach the Agency is proposing for project selection is successful in creating a diversity of 
community solar projects and organizational structures in Illinois. Therefore, the Agency expects that 
in the next update of the Long-Term Plan (to be initiated in the summer of 2023 for implementation 
for the 2024 delivery year) this approach may be substantially revised, and the Agency will seek 
stakeholder feedback as part of that revision process. 
 
331 Local subscribers are subscribers in the same county as the project, or if that project’s county population is below 50,000, then also in 
adjacent counties.

7.4.6.  Equity Eligible Contractor (“EEC”) 
The EEC category includes Distributed Generation projects as well as community solar projects that 
have been submitted to the Program by Equity Eligible Contractor Approved Vendors per the 
guidelines specified in Section 7.7.3.332 At least 10% of the capacity of the ABP shall come from 
projects submitted by applicants that are EEC certified. EEC certified Approved Vendors may also 
submit projects into other program categories and are not limited to the EEC category. To give the 
market for EEC projects time to develop, for the 2022-2023 and the 2023-2024 delivery years, the 
Agency does not propose increasing the portion the Adjustable Block Program allocated to EEC 
projects above the 10% level, but expects that in the next Long-Term Plan which will cover the 
subsequent two delivery years, the Agency will begin to increase that percentage with the goal of 
reaching 40% by the 2030 delivery year. 
At this time, the Agency is not proposing specific sub-categories within the EEC category for specific 
project types as it believes that it needs to give time for this sector to develop and does not want to 
prematurely limit project applications. Furthermore, for this 2022 Long-Term Plan the Agency is not 
proposing different REC prices for EEC projects than the comparable DG or Community Solar projects 
(which would recognize variations in project size and geographic location), rather the Agency is 
proposing that the key value of participation in the EEC category is the opportunity for the advance 
of capital to overcome financing barriers.  
 The IPA will work to reduce and eliminate barriers to participation in all of its programs to the fullest 
extent possible.  The Agency will regularly solicit feedback from stakeholders and EEC program 
participants on the subject of eliminating or reducing barriers to participation in IPA programs, 
beginning with a stakeholder feedback process to solicit input on how to increase participation by 
EECs in the Program.  In approving this Plan, the Commission noted with approval the IPA’s 
“commitment to continue to monitor this ABP category and to work with stakeholders to identity 
barriers and streamline the process.”333 
7.4.6.1.  Equity Eligible Contractor Advance of Capital 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(iv) of the IPA Act specifies that,  
The Agency shall propose a payment structure for contracts executed pursuant to this 
paragraph under which, upon a demonstration of qualification or need, applicant firms 
are advanced capital disbursed after contract execution but before the contracted 
project's energization. The amount or percentage of capital advanced prior to project 
energization shall be sufficient to both cover any increase in development costs resulting 
from prevailing  wage  requirements  or project-labor  agreements  and  designed  to 
overcome barriers in access to capital faced by equity eligible contractors. 
Up to 50% of contract value may be advanced to an EEC-certified Approved Vendor under this 
provision.  
A particular challenge that the Agency has identified with the advance of capital is the risk of projects 
not being completed, despite the advance of capital. Therefore, the Agency proposes the following 
risk mitigation requirements. First, to be eligible for an advance of capital, an EEC will need to include 
 
332 For the initial block of capacity for Equity Eligible Contractors, only distributed generation applications were accepted.

the request for the advance of capital in the Part I application of the project, along with a short 
narrative description of the need being addressed, and what key project development milestone will 
trigger the disbursement. The narrative description should include a breakdown of costs that the 
advance will cover and may be submitted on a confidential basis. Once a project has been Part I 
verified and the contract or product order approved by the Commission, the EEC will then submit 
verification of achievement of the specified milestones to the Agency for review and approval. The 
EEC will then invoice the utility for the advancement following the regular invoicing process and the 
utilities will process this invoice following the same, with the payments made by the contracting 
utility on the regular monthly invoicing cycle. 
The Agency will use the information gained in first two years of this option’s availability to refine 
how advances of capital will be addressed in future Long-Term Plans.  For an EEC who benefits from 
an advance of capital, but projects are not completed and the EEC does not return the advanced funds, 
that EEC will face disciplinary action and will not be eligible to submit additional project applications 
to the Adjustable Block Program until that debt is paid.  
As outlined Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(vi) of the IPA Act, once the advance of capital is approved by the 
Agency, the capital will be disbursed with the following limitation on payments made upon and after 
that project’s energization:  
Capital advanced prior to energization shall serve to reduce the ratable payments made 
after energization under items (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (L) or payments made for 
each renewable energy credit delivery under item (iv) of subparagraph (L). 
7.4.6.2.  EEC Eligibility 
Section 7.7.3 describes in detail the requirements for an Approved Vendor to become certified as an 
Equity Eligible Contractor. Eligibility for this category is limited to Approved Vendors who qualify as 
an EEC.  Equity Eligible Contractor Approved Vendors may choose to work with Designees or on their 
own, and those Designees may or may not also be EEC qualified.  However, Approved Vendors that 
are not EECs but partner with a Designee that qualifies an Equity Eligible Contractor are ineligible to 
submit projects.334 
While the Agency understands that there may be interest in models where a Designee is an Equity 
Eligible Contractor, but they operate under an Approved Vendor who is not an Equity Eligible 
Contractor,  the  Agency  cannot  reconcile  that  with  Section  1-75(c)(1)(K)(iv)  of  the  IPA  Act’s 
requirement that this category is for projects “from applicants that are equity eligible contractors.” 
Applicants in the Adjustable Block Program are Approved Vendors, as they are ultimately the entity 
that holds the REC delivery contract with a utility. The concept of a Designee was developed by the 
Agency to ensure that program requirements and accountability flow through to the entities involved 
in sales, marketing, subscriber acquisition, construction, and installation. It does not change who is 
the applicant into the program, as Designees are not permitted to submit project applications to the 
program. The Agency also hopes that this approach will minimize the risk that entities that are not 
Equity Eligible Contractors inappropriately benefit from this category.  
Projects that are developed by Approved Vendors certified as Equity Eligible Contractors and receive 
a REC contract through the EEC block of capacity may not assign those projects to an Approved

Vendor that is not also a certified Equity Eligible Contractor for six years after the Part II verification 
date of the project. After six years from the Part II verification date has passed, this moratorium on 
assigning EEC projects to Approved Vendors that are not certified as an EEC is lifted. 
7.5. REC Pricing Model 
7.5.1.   Background 
For the Initial Plan, the IPA adopted and modified the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Cost 
of Renewable Energy Spreadsheet Tool (“CREST”) to develop a model for calculating REC prices. 
CREST is an economic cash flow model that estimates the cost of energy in terms of cents per kilowatt 
hour associated with specific input assumptions regarding technology type, location, system capital 
and operating costs, expected production, project useful life, and various project financing variables. 
The Agency’s REC pricing model established initial pricing for each block, with prices then declining 
4% for each subsequent block.   
In its Order approving the First Revised Plan, the Commission stated that “REC prices must be lower,” 
although  it  neglected  to  adopt  any  specific  proposal  for  how  to  lower  such  prices  (and  no 
methodology for lowering prices was introduced into the record).335  Instead, the Commission 
required that “workshops should be held and stakeholder input considered” regarding how REC 
prices could be lowered, with a need to be mindful that, going forward, “the IPA must recognize 
market signals rather than solely relying on its cost modeling approach” in determining REC prices.   
The Agency solicited stakeholder feedback on REC pricing in November 2020336 and further feedback 
after a workshop in July 2021.337 Generally, most stakeholders favored maintaining the 4% decline 
between blocks, but there was some concern that community solar REC prices remain too high. 
Alternatively, stated concerns that would argue against a decline in REC prices included the decrease 
in the Federal Investment Tax Credit from 30% to 26%, a decline in energy prices (which would 
reduce net metering credit value), higher than expected interconnection costs (particularly for 
community solar), and ongoing uncertainty about the future value of smart inverter rebates.338   
When the Agency released the now withdrawn draft Second Revised Plan, it offered an example of 
what REC prices would look like with a continuation of the 4% decline between blocks as well as REC 
price modeling based upon updating certain inputs to the original pricing model approved in the 
Initial Plan.339 With the enactment of Public Act 102-0662, two key changes were made that impact 
the Agency’s REC price modeling. First, three new categories of projects were introduced (Public 
Schools projects, Community-Driven Community Solar projects, and Equity Eligible Contractors 
projects), with one of those new categories, Public Schools projects as well as the existing category 
for Traditional Community Solar, now featuring 20-year contracts rather than 15-year contracts. The 
second change is that rather than blocks opening as the previous block close, blocks are now set on 
an annual basis to correlate with energy delivery years (June 1 to May 31). As a result, the concept of 
 
335 See Docket No. 19-0995, Final Order dated Feb. 18, 2020 at 46. 
336 See: https://illinoisabp.com/stakeholder-feedback-rec-pricing-feedback-request/. 
337 See: https://ipa.illinois.gov/renewable-resources/workshop-information.html. 
338 The Agency notes that since the time that feedback was received, energy prices rose significantly in the second half of 2021. 
339  A  description  of  the  updated  inputs  is  contained  in  Section  6.3  of  the  withdrawn  draft  Second  Revised  Plan.  See: 
https://ipa.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/ipa/documents/draftsecondrevisedplan16august.pdf and additional information is 
contained in Appendices D and E at: https://ipa.illinois.gov/energy-procurement/second-revised-ltrrpp-appendices.html.

177,185,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
4% declines between blocks no longer fits the program design and the Agency instead proposes to 
conduct an annual update to REC prices, as described below in Section 7.5.7. 
For the 2022 Long-Term Plan as initially filed with the Commission, the Agency updated the modeling 
conducted for the withdrawn draft Second Revised Plan in several ways and used that updated 
modeling as the basis for the REC prices contained in this Plan. First, it updated the cost of installation 
to account for an estimate of incremental impact of prevailing wage requirements where applicable. 
This update follows the price adjustment the Agency used for REC prices for the non-waitlisted Large 
DG blocks that opened in December 2021 but now applies across a wider set of program categories.340 
Second, for those categories now featuring 20-year contracts, the model was adjusted for a larger 
quantity of REC deliveries that provide corresponding revenue to the project.  Third, for the 
community solar categories, rather than having an adder for various levels of small subscribers, given 
the new requirement that all projects have at least 50% small subscribers, the previous value the 
Agency proposed in the withdrawn Second Revised for the 50% small subscriber adder has been 
included in all community solar prices and there is no longer a separate adder for small subscribers.  
Each of those changes were approved by the Commission, along with additional modifications 
explained further below.341 
Perhaps most notably, through the Plan approval process in ICC Docket No. 22-0231, stakeholders 
raised objections and made various proposals to further modify the Agency’s REC Pricing Model, 
either through structural changes to the model itself or updated inputs.  The IPA proposed to engage 
an independent expert consultant to complete a thorough review of REC prices prior to the next 
update of the Agency’s Long-Term Plan.  The independent expert consultant will provide the IPA with 
recommendations on how to develop administratively-set REC prices that both efficiently invest 
ratepayer funds in renewables and respond annually to changing market conditions.  The IPA will 
provide transparency around the results of the review and utilize the independent analysis to craft 
REC prices for the next Plan.   The Commission agreed with this approach and noted that it looks 
forward to reviewing the recommendations of the Agency’s independent expert consultant in its 
Order approving this Plan.342 
The Agency also made a significant change to Appendix E which contains the spreadsheets used to 
calculate REC prices. For the withdrawn draft Second Revised Plan, each category and group was 
presented in a separate spreadsheet, with a total of 16 separate spreadsheets for REC prices for the 
Adjustable Block Program and the Illinois Solar for All Program. The Agency has now consolidated 
the REC pricing model into a single spreadsheet which automatically recalculates REC prices through 
drop-down menu selections. This new spreadsheet also groups assumptions used in modeling into 
consolidated tables which will allow stakeholders to compare differences between categories in a 
single view. While the change in the spreadsheet design does not impact the resulting REC prices, it 
is intended to allow for easier review of modeling assumptions by stakeholders, and also to allow 
stakeholders to use the modeling tool to test how changes in assumptions would impact REC prices.

7.5.2.  Modeling Update 
As part of the development of the withdrawn draft Second Revised Plan the Agency undertook the 
exercise of updating the REC Pricing Model. Changes from that update, along with modifications 
approved by the Commission in Docket No. 22-0231,  are now included in this 2022 Long-Term Plan. 
Key changes include: 
•  Adjustment of the Federal Investment Tax Credit to 22%  
•  Updated project cost information based on the U.S. Solar Photovoltaic System and 
Energy Storage Cost Benchmark: Q1 2020 Report from NREL.343 This also includes 
reducing the impact of tariffs on imported modules to the current level. Community 
Solar projects now reflect costs for tracking rather than fixed-mount systems.  Finally, 
development costs and fees for 5 MW systems were extrapolated from 2 MW system 
data to create inputs for the larger system sizes.344 
•  Updated AC/DC ratios based on an analysis of actual project applications received 
and energized and capacity factors based on PVWatts analyses of energized projects. 
However, due to the lack of Community Solar projects below 500 kW, for smaller 
community solar size categories, DG project data was utilized. Capital costs have also 
been adjusted to reflect these AC/DC ratios. Update of net metering credit values and 
energy values to current values, including the value capacity for projects over 25 kW, 
and applicable tariffs. Net metering annual increases were also adjusted from 2% to 
1%. 
•  An increased in the length of time for construction. 
•  For systems up to 25 kW, interconnection costs are now set at $200 to reflect the 
changes made to Section 16-107.5(h-5)(3) of the Public Utilities Act regarding Level 
1 interconnection costs. 
•  An update of Community Solar interconnection costs based on a survey of Approved 
Vendors with actual interconnection costs for energized Community Solar projects. 
•  Adjustments to account for the cost of prevailing wage requirements. 
•  Adjustments to reflect the length of the REC delivery contract, and Public Schools 
projects modeled using an alternative cash flow model as described in Appendix D.    
•  The cost community solar small subscriber management is now included in the 
community solar REC prices rather than reflected as an adder based on subscription 
levels. 
•  Adjustment to the assumed subscriber savings for the Non-Profit and Public Facilities 
subprogram of Illinois Solar for All.345 
•  Adjustment to the bonus depreciation value to 80% to reflect the phase out of bonus 
depreciation by 2026.346

•  Adoption of five-year historical average price inputs for capacity charges for non-
residential modeled systems and five-year historical, seasonally-weighted averaged 
purchased electricity charges for systems modeled on the 10 kW system size.347  
Examples of inputs that were not updated include financing structure (e.g., debt ratios and project 
financing interest rates), internal rates of return, and O&M costs. These inputs are all listed in detail 
in Appendices D and E.  
A description of the REC Pricing Model and inputs used is contained in Appendix D and the REC

Note that as discussed in Section 7.4.6, for this 2022 Long-Term Plan the Agency is not proposing 
separate prices for projects in Equity Eligible Contractor category. Those projects will instead feature 
the opportunity for the advance of capital. Equity Eligible Contractor projects would use the 
applicable REC price for distributed generation or community-driven community solar (as they 
 
349 These prices are consistent with those published by the Agency on August 1, 2022.

would be under 15-year contracts). In addition, a Public Schools project that is community solar 
would receive the Traditional Community Solar REC price applicable to the project’s size. 
7.5.3.  Adjustments  
Adjustments are intended to adjust the base REC price to meet specific additional purposes. These 
include adjusting for system size, and for adjusting for the additional costs of small subscribers for 
community solar projects. 
While the Act seeks to encourage projects “in diverse locations and are not concentrated in a few 
regional areas,”350 at this time the Agency is not proposing any specific geographic REC price adders 
for distributed generation projects. The Agency believes that the split of the blocks between utility 
service territories adequately addresses program-wide/statewide geographic diversity, and DG 
project applications to date indicate that projects are well distributed across the state.  
The Agency observes that while projects are spread across the state at a high level, community solar 
projects are predominantly located in rural areas that are not likely to be close to subscribers. The 
Agency expects that the creation of the new category of Community-Driven Community Solar will 
address this issue and result in community solar projects in more suburban and urban areas that will 
increase the diversity of community solar project locations. 
7.5.4.  Size Category Adjustments 
Prior to the enactment of Public Act 102-0662, Small DG projects were defined as projects up to and 
including 10 kW in size. That size has been increased to up to and including 25 kW. The Agency 
proposes to now have two price levels within the Small DG category, one for projects up to and 
including 10 kW and one for projects over 10 kW up to and including 25 kW. The price for projects 
up to and including 10 kW does not include an adjustment the incremental cost of prevailing wage 
requirements. Most residential projects are under 10 kW in size (and similarly most projects under 
10 kW are residential), so the use of two levels provides a proxy for that adjustment. 
For all other categories, the Agency proposes to have the smallest size category for projects up to and 
including 25 kW, and then subsequent category sizes for projects 25 kW up to and including 100 kW, 
over 100 kW up to and including 200 kW, over 200 kW up to and including 500 kW, and over 500 kW 
up to and including 2 MW, and over 2 MW up to and including 5 MW, with adjustments to REC prices 
reflecting modeled development costs by size category.351    
7.5.5.  Co-location of Distributed Generation Systems 
For purposes of Adjustable Block Program categories and applicable REC prices, the total capacity of 
distributed generation systems energized after June 1, 2017 on a single parcel that participate in the 
Adjustable Block Program are considered a single system.352 (For example, three 100 kW systems on 
a single parcel will be considered a 300 kW system.) If a system on a single parcel is subsequently 
expanded, the Agency reserves the right to revise the incentive amounts paid for the subsequent 
 
350 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(K).  
351 As per the Commission’s Order in Docket No. 22-0231, the IPA will explore additional subcategories across Large DG projects for its 
next Long-Term Plan.  See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 96.   
352 Any system developed under this program would require a separate GATS or M-RETS ID from any system developed through a different 
program (e.g., the Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurement or the Utility DG procurements) or without programmatic support. This would 
allow for a clear demarcation between systems and their associated RECs.

system(s), and to set the incentives based on the total expanded system size rather than just treat the 
expansion as a separate system. For the purpose of establishing a revised incentive level under these 
circumstances, the systems’ location would be considered at the parcel level. Exceptions will be made 
if it can be demonstrated that two projects on one parcel have separate, non-affiliated owners and 
serve to offset the load of separate, non-affiliated entities on a parcel.  
In rural areas of Illinois, it is not uncommon for a parcel to have buildings (and thus load to be offset 
by distributed generation) that serve separate residential and agricultural uses.  The Agency will 
evaluate requests to consider those uses separately for the application of this standard.  
The Agency’s co-location determinations only apply to distributed generation projects participating 
in the Adjustable Block Program and not projects installed outside of the Program (e.g., through 
previously  conducted  Agency  procurements,  receiving  DCEO  rebates,  or  developed  without 
incentives). It also does not apply to the co-location of distributed generation and community solar 
projects. Co-location of community solar projects is discussed in Section 7.9.4.  
7.5.6.  Community Solar 
Community solar projects face additional costs and feature reduced eligibility for direct energy-
related revenues than distributed generation systems. On the revenue side, subscribers to such 
projects are eligible only for energy-only net metering, while on the cost side, there is the cost of 
acquiring, maintaining, and managing subscribers. The prices for community solar RECs compared 
to distributed generation projects as shown above in Table 7-5 reflect those differences. 
In the Initial Long-Term Plan, the Agency included adders for community solar projects with higher 
levels of small subscribers (residential and small commercial customers with subscriptions below 25 
kW). For the Revised Plan, the Agency eliminated the Initial Plan’s highest adder for over 75% small 
subscribers and had the largest adder available for projects featuring over 50% small subscribers. 
This left the adders ranging from $11.17/$10.88, for Groups A and B respectively for projects with 
over 25% small subscribers, and less than 50% to $22.34/$21.77 respectively, for projects with 50% 
or greater small subscribers. 
The Agency continued to have concerns that these adders may have been too high. These adders were 
developed using an analysis of community solar subscription costs contained in the Initial Plan. The 
Agency notes that a 2018 GTM Research report353 contained estimates of subscriber acquisition costs 
that ranged from $0.06 to $0.25 per Watt and ongoing subscriber management (including billing and 
replacing subscribers) of $0.12 to $0.35 per Watt. The low end of the combined costs from those 
estimates would be $0.18 per Watt and the high end $0.60 per Watt. Translating those costs to the 
REC output over 15 years of a typical 2 MW community solar project (with a 22% AC capacity factor), 
those ranges would imply additional subscriber-related costs of $6.85 to $22.83 per REC, which 
indicates that those small subscriber adders were too high, especially if the prior adder for systems 
with greater than 75% small subscriber participation had been maintained.

Another data point suggesting a lower adder comes from Minnesota, which utilized the equivalent of 
$15/REC for a two-year pilot for projects that energized in 2019 or 2020 (and is currently undergoing 
review with stakeholders advocating for its extension).354  
For the withdrawn draft Second Revised Plan, the Agency sought stakeholder feedback on if small 
subscriber adders should be reduced. The shift to online marketing and enrollment is likely an 
additional cost savings for community solar providers that may not have been reflected in the 
original current adder. The Agency suggested starting with the midpoint of the range of costs 
reported by GTRM Research, or $14.82/REC for 50% or over small subscriber levels (and a lower 
adder for projects in the 25-50% small subscriber range). This approach produced adders very 
similar to the current Minnesota adder.  
Public Act 102-0662 now requires that community solar projects have a minimum of 50% small 
subscribers. This renders the need to have an adder for different levels of small subscriber levels 
unnecessary, as there would no longer be the possibility of a project having between 25 and 50% 
small subscribers. As the Agency had already proposed basing the highest level adder as being at the 
50% of higher small subscriber level, the amount that was previously broken out as an adder is now 
proposed to be included in all community solar REC prices. The Agency proposes maintaining its 
suggestion  from  the  withdrawn  draft  Second  Revised  Plan  of  having  that  adjustment  set  at 
$14.82/REC. The Agency further notes that changes to community solar net metering contained in 
Section 16-107.5(l)(3) of the Public Utilities Act will allow Ameren and ComEd to offer consolidated 
billing for community solar projects, which is a potential additional decrease in the cost of managing 
small subscriber subscriptions.  In approving this approach, the Commission noted that the REC price 
for community solar is clearly sufficient to support participation in the program based upon the over-
subscription of the Traditional Community Solar category.355  
7.5.7.  Updating of REC Prices 
Prior to the enactment of Public Act 102-0662, there were two ways REC prices could change. The 
first was when a block of capacity closed, the next block would open at a new, lower price and the 
Agency set that price decline at 4% between blocks. The second way that REC prices could change 
was a provision of Section 1-75(c)(1)(M) of the IPA Act that allowed the Agency to change prices (and 
other program elements) by up to 25% without seeking Commission approval, but with stakeholder 
input. During the period of 2019 through 2021, the Agency did not make any such REC price 
adjustments. 
Public Act 102-0662 now sets blocks to be based on capacity for a given energy delivery year. As a 
result, the approach of having REC prices decline by 4% between blocks is now less appropriate. 
Under the prior model the rate of progression between blocks was determined by market activity. 
More applications received by the program meant faster closing of blocks, and prices changing more 
often; thus fewer applications received by the program, and prices would be maintained for a longer 
time. As the transition between blocks will now occur on a known schedule, occurring every June 1, 
the Agency proposes that rather than having a pre-determined price change between blocks, that 
instead the Agency conduct an annual refresh of the REC Pricing Model described above. This will

184,192,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
include refreshing inputs from known sources and seeking stakeholder feedback on preliminary 
prices.  
For the 2022-2023 delivery year, REC prices will be as approved by the Commission through the 
Commission’s approval the 2022 Long-Term Plan. For the 2023-2024 delivery year, the Agency 
proposes to begin the updating of the REC pricing model in January of 2023 with the release of a draft 
new set of REC prices for stakeholder feedback. The Agency will consider that feedback and finalize 
REC prices by May 1, 2023.  
The other mechanism for changing REC prices is Section 1-75(c)(1)(M)’s allowance that “[p]rogram 
modifications to any block price that do not deviate from the Commission's approved value by more 
than 10% [and] shall take effect immediately and are not subject to Commission review and 
approval.”    This  adjustment  level  was  reduced  from  25%  to  10%    by  Public  Act  106-0662. 
Furthermore, any modifications to prices require stakeholder feedback and advance notification. 
There are several reasons why the Agency might consider a mid-year price adjustment, but the IPA 
would only do so if it determines that changing circumstances have created a genuine need for an 
adjustment. Examples of such circumstances would include changes to federal legislation that impact 
the Investment Tax Credit, new tariffs on imported panels and modules, or significant changes to net 
metering credits or the smart inverter rebate (however smart inverter rebates will not change prior 
to December 2024, which is outside the time period covered by this 2022 Long-Term Plan).  If the 
Agency becomes aware of a circumstance that would warrant consideration of a mid-year REC price 
adjustment, it will conduct modeling of REC price changes and conduct a stakeholder feedback 
process before making any changes. 
Following the Commission’s approval of this Plan, federal legislation was enacted on August 16, 2022, 
which includes extensions of and enhancements to the structure of the Investment Tax Credit, which 
would have a significant impact on the REC Pricing model.  However, any such changes to REC prices 
based upon the enactment of the federal Inflation Recovery Act will require time to evaluate and 
adjust; accordingly, the Agency will not incorporate such changes into REC Prices until the 2023-
2024 delivery year.356 
Finally, as discussed above, the Agency will retain an independent expert consultant to conduct a re-
evaluation of the REC Pricing Model prior to the release of the 2024 Long-Term Plan.357  The 
recommendations provided by the expert consultant will be utilized in the development of the REC 
Prices for future years and governed by future Plans.  At the earliest, the IPA believes that the 
recommendations may be used to inform the adjustments to REC prices for the 2024-2025 and 2025-
2026 delivery years. 
7.6. Prevailing Wage 
As outlined in Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q) of the IPA Act, most Adjustable Block Program project proposals 
must  comply  with  Illinois  Prevailing  Wage  Act  requirements.  Prevailing  wage  is  a  minimum 
compensation level by county set by the Illinois Department of Labor for construction activities 
related to public works. Section 1-75(c)(1)(Q) of the IPA Act (20 ILCS 3855) now requires that 
individuals engaged in the construction of applicable projects submitted to the Program are paid the

prevailing wage. Additionally, Public Act 102-0673 clarifies that projects receiving incentives under 
the  Program  are  “public  works”  subject  to  the  Prevailing  Wage  Act—which  includes  notice 
requirements and related provisions as well. For Adjustable Block Program administration, Illinois 
law allows only the following types of projects to be considered exempt from prevailing wage 
requirements:  
•  Large Distributed Generation projects (greater than 25 kW AC) that were on a waitlist as of 
the program’s reopening on December 14, 2021  
•  Distributed generation projects (Large or Small) that either serve a single-family or multi-
family residential building, or serve a house of worship and are not greater than 100 kW AC 
(aggregated with any co-located projects)  
•  Distributed generation projects (Large or Small) for which construction can be demonstrated 
to have been completed before September 15, 2021, the effective date of Public Act 102-0662.  
A project application sized between 10-25 kW for which an application was originally received in the 
Large Distributed Generation category (i.e., on or before November 1, 2021 when the ABP application 
portal closed to applications in preparation for program reopening on December 14, 2021) will be 
considered a waitlisted Large Distributed Generation project for prevailing wage purposes, although 
that project will otherwise be reclassified as a Small Distributed Generation project for processing 
the project application and that reclassification will be reflected in the REC price and payment terms.  
After the enactment of Public Act 102-0673, projects that do not qualify for one of the above 
exemptions must comply with all provisions of the Prevailing Wage Act (“PWA”). The Illinois 
Department of Labor (“DOL”) oversees the implementation and enforcement of the Prevailing Wage 
Act and has multiple resources, such as FAQs, available on its website.358 The Prevailing Wage Act 
requires that employees engaged in construction activities related to the project be paid the 
prevailing wage of that location, as determined by the DOL annually and updated regularly on its 
website. The Approved Vendor, its contractors, and its subcontractors must provide written notice 
to all contractors and subcontractors that the PWA applies to the project, including notice and record 
keeping requirements; penalties and fines for violations may be imposed on upstream contractors if 
they did not provide proper notice to subcontractors. Employees engaged in construction activities 
must be given written notice of the applicable prevailing wage rates through posting those rates on 
the work site, at a central office, or through direct written communication. Each contractor and 
subcontractor under contract for construction activities for the project must submit a Certified 
Transcript of Payroll (“CTP”) using the DOL Certified Transcript of Payroll Portal on a monthly basis 
throughout construction activities. Templates for the CTP and additional details on what to include 
may be found on the DOL website. Approved Vendors must also submit all CTPs from the project to 
the Program Administrator.  
Part I of the project application for non-exempted projects will require that an Approved Vendor 
certify its understanding that prevailing wage requirements apply to that project, and the Part I 
verification  will  include  the  Program  Administrator’s  determination  regarding  applicability  of 
prevailing wage requirements. In Part II of the project application, the Approved Vendor will be 
required to certify to and document compliance with prevailing wage requirements, if applicable.

All projects subject to prevailing wage requirements may be subject to auditing by the Program 
Administrator to verify compliance. This auditing includes a requirement to admit the Program 
Administrator or their representatives to work sites for ongoing projects, access to speak to 
employees who are working or have worked on projects, access to requested documentation 
demonstrating payment of wages including but not limited to Certified Transcripts of Payroll, and 
any other information the Program Administrator deems necessary to confirm compliance with this 
requirement. Failure to comply with prevailing wage requirements is considered a violation of 
program requirements. While the Agency may refer potential violations of the PWA to the DOL for 
further investigation and enforcement, the Agency may also take disciplinary action against any 
Approved Vendor or Designee found to have violated the PWA on a facility for which there was a REC 
contract under the ABP. 
7.7. Approved Vendors 
Participation in the Adjustable Block Program takes place through, and is conditional upon, the 
Approved Vendor process developed by the Agency and implemented by the Program Administrator. 
The Approved Vendor model was originally based upon the experiences the Agency gained through 
the development and implementation of the Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurement, as well as 
observations of programs in other states. While arguably there could be more flexibility available to 
consumers through a program under which any entity may receive a contract, by having Approved 
Vendors—i.e., ensuring that any entity receiving a REC delivery contract is registered with and vetted 
by the Agency, and has met conditions predicate—the Agency is better able to monitor compliance 
with program terms and conditions, ensure the accuracy and quality of information submitted, and 
reduce the administrative burden on the contractual counterparties.  
This model thus benefits consumers because they can verify that an entity that proposes to develop 
a photovoltaic system for them (or sell them a subscription to a community solar project) is a 
legitimate entity participating in the Program.  It is important for the Agency to have the ability to 
monitor the program and ensure high quality performance by the Approved Vendors; an Approved 
Vendor that fails to live up to the requirements of the Adjustable Block Program could have a 
significant negative impact on the entire renewable energy market in Illinois that would extend 
beyond just its own actions. Additionally, as discussed in more detail in Chapter 8, registration as an 
Adjustable Block Program Approved Vendor is a prerequisite to becoming an Illinois Solar for All 
Approved Vendor, and the loss or suspension of Approved Vendor status under the Adjustable Block 
Program would result in an Approved Vendor’s status under the Illinois Solar for All Program to also 
being terminated or suspended. 
The Agency does not restrict Approved Vendor participation by entity type; as such, Approved 
Vendors could include a company that specializes in the aggregation and management of RECs; a for-
profit developer or installer of photovoltaic systems; a municipality; or a non-profit serving a specific 
sector of the community, among others.  
Approved Vendors serve as the contractual counterparty with the utility, and thus are the entity that 
receives payments from the utility for REC deliveries as contract obligations are met.359 Approved 
Vendors are therefore responsible for submitting necessary paperwork (project applications, status 
updates, quarterly and annual reports) to the Program Administrator (as the responsible party for 
 
359 The Agency imposes no requirement as to how the Approved Vendor shall share the REC payments with the installer, host, and other 
project parties.

the information contained in that paperwork), maintaining collateral requirements (and paying any 
contractual clawback not covered by posted collateral), and providing ongoing information and 
reporting.  As  such,  the  Approved  Vendors  must  coordinate  downstream  information  from 
installers/developers  as  well  as  individual  system  owners  (who  may  well  provide  required 
information through the installer/developer). Failure to provide this necessary information in a 
timely manner may result in disciplinary action as customers may be negatively impacted by an 
Approved Vendor’s lack of responsiveness.  
The Agency does not require a specific delegation of duties between the Approved Vendor, sales 
generating firms, installer/developer, and system owner; rather, it believes that the market is better 
suited to allow a variety of business arrangements to develop. The key consideration is that the 
Approved Vendor is ultimately responsible for the fulfillment of contractual obligations, including 
any obligations delegated to subcontractors, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this 
Plan, other published program requirements stemming from this Plan (such as those found in the 
Program Guidebook and Marketing Guidelines), and the Approved Vendor’s contract with the 
counterparty utility.  
As discussed in Section 7.8, the Agency now requires that Designees (entities working with or on 
behalf of Approved Vendors for participating projects) be registered with the program. While this 
does not change the responsibilities of the Approved Vendor, or the potential for an Approved Vendor 
to be held accountable for the conduct of its Designee, the Agency believes that this step provides 
additional information and transparency to consumers and to the marketplace generally. 
Approved Vendors must agree to the following terms: 
•  Participate in registration and complete any training developed by the Agency 
•  Abide by these ongoing Program terms and conditions  
•  Provide information to the Agency on the Approved Vendor’s organizational history, capacity, 
financial  information,  regulatory  status  in  Illinois  and  other  states  (including  current 
complaints or other actions against the Vendor or prior complaints within the past five 
years), etc.  
•  Disclose whether the entity is minority, woman, disabled, or veteran-owned, and provide an 
estimate of the percentage of staff at time of registration and subsequent annual renewals 
who are women, disabled, veterans, or minorities. This process will include specifying with 
which certification programs the business has registered. 
•  Be registered to do business in Illinois 
•  Disclose to the Agency names and other information on installers and projects, while 
otherwise maintaining confidentiality of information 
•  Document that all installers and other subcontractors comply with applicable local, state, and 
federal laws and regulations, including for example, maintaining Distributed Generation 
Installer Certification  
•  Provide samples of any marketing materials or content used by the Approved Vendor, and/or 
their subcontractors/installers, designees, agents, and affiliates, to the Agency for review, as 
requested.360  
 
360 This requirement applies to, at minimum, printed materials, advertising through television and radio, websites (including affiliate 
websites), web ads, marketing via email or social media, telemarketing scripts, and leads purchased through lead-generation vendors.

7.7.1.  Supporting Stranded Distributed Generation Customers 
One issue that has arisen since the approval of the Revised Long-Term Plan in 2020 is the creation of 
“stranded” ABP distributed generation customers when an Approved Vendor goes out of business, is 
having financial difficulties and is unwilling or unable to pass through promised REC payments, or is 
suspended as a disciplinary action and prohibited from advancing projects through the application 
process.  The  stranded  customer  may  be  left  without  an  Approved  Vendor  to  advance  their 
application through the review process, or to pass through promised REC payments from the 
contracting utility. As part of the 2022 Long-Term Plan, the Agency is seeking Commission approval 
of a proposed approach to address this issue.  
The Agency’s primary concern is a positive resolution for the customer, including a path forward for 
their project to be completed, approved as part of the ABP, and for the customer to receive promised 
REC payments, if possible. Within the ABP, the Agency has recently encountered two situations where 
customers  were  effectively  stranded  by  an  Approved  Vendor.    In  both  cases,  the  Program 
Administrator was able to communicate with the affected customers and assist them in finding 
another Approved Vendor that was willing to take on the customer’s contract. 
The Agency believes that the option of referring customers to a designated aggregator Approved 
Vendor that is willing to take on stranded customers is the best option for handling these types of 
situations. Many customers will not have the time, interest, or ability to find a new Approved Vendor 
on their own, especially because the customer may not understand the Program well enough to 
explain the situation to other Approved Vendors. Furthermore, the Agency’s understanding is that 
most Approved Vendors would not be interested in taking on stranded customers because the limited 
financial benefit to the Approved Vendor, especially if REC payments have been made. If the prefers 
to find a new Approved Vendor on their own, rather than use the aggregator Approved Vendor to 
whom the Program Administrator refers them, they may do so. 
The Agency may also consider developing other processes to address the stranded customer issue. 
This may include, in these limited circumstances, allowing customers to directly receive incentive 
payments (through loosening requirements around batching with other projects) by becoming a 
single project Approved Vendor, or allowing the Program Administrator to function as an Approved 
Vendor of last resort.  The Agency would only make such substantive programmatic if a need for it 
emerges, such as a dramatic increase in the number of stranded customers or the inability of any 
alternative Approved Vendor to take on stranded customers. In such circumstances, the Agency 
would develop new procedures through a stakeholder process. 
 
361 This requirement is not meant to impede the ability to market to customers, but rather to ensure that any types of marketing are not 
deceptive, confusing, or misleading. Likewise, the Agency is concerned about misrepresentations that could be made about the relationship 
between an Approved Vendor (or the subcontractors/installers) and the Agency or program.

189,197,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
7.7.2.  Approved Vendor Applications 
Approved Vendors must have their approval renewed once a year. Failure by an Approved Vendor to 
follow the requirements of the Adjustable Block Program, as determined by the Agency and/or its 
Program Administrator, may result in the entity having the suspension of or losing its status as an 
Approved Vendor and thus losing the ability to bring new projects into the programs. Losing that 
status would not relieve an Approved Vendor of its obligations to ensure that RECs from its projects 
that have been energized continue to be delivered to the applicable utility; failure to meet those 
contractual obligations could result in having the Vendor’s credit collateral drawn upon. (See Section 
7.12.1 for more discussion of contractual obligations.) As part of the renewal process, Approved 
Vendors will submit their training materials and certifications showing that their agents have been 
trained in accordance with program requirements. The Program Administrator may request other 
materials and documents upon renewal as well, including, but not limited to, marketing materials 
and employee training materials.  
The Agency recognizes that there may be certain projects where the Approved Vendor model may 
not be completely appropriate, and therefore allows an Approved Vendor who has only one project 
to apply under a more limited set of requirements as a Single Project Approved Vendor. Specifically, 
this designation may apply to a project that is owned by that Single Project Approved Vendor (as 
opposed to a situation where the Approved Vendor is an intermediary between the system developer 
and/or owner and the contracting utility). In this situation, the following provisions related to 
Approved Vendors do not apply: 
•  Provide samples of any marketing materials or content used by the Approved Vendor, and/or 
their subcontractors/installers and affiliates, to the Agency for review, as requested.  
•  Agree to make changes to marketing materials as instructed by the Agency. 
In addition, the consumer protection requirements found Chapter 9 would not apply to the Single 
Project Approved Vendor for a distributed generation project, but if the project is a community solar 
system, all applicable community solar consumer protection requirements related to subscribers do 
apply (including those concerning marketing materials referenced above). 
Single Project Approved Vendors will need to request that status prior to submitting their system’s 
Part I application, and the Program Administrator and Agency will review requests to ensure that 
this process is not used to avoid the more general requirements of this program through the 
establishment of nominally separate entities. The minimum size for a project submitted by a Single 
Project Approved Vendor is 100 kW. 
The Agency also encourages the hiring of graduates of job training programs (as described in Sections 
8.8.1 and 8.9.1) to work on installations of projects supported by the Adjustable Block Program. The 
Program Administrator currently requests Approved Vendors to report on the planned usage of job 
training program graduates as part of the project application process and requires reporting on job 
trainee hiring as part of the annual reports submitted by each Approved Vendor.  
As more trainees become available, the Program Administrator will provide additional information 
to Approved Vendors to support this goal.

7.7.3.  Equity Eligible Contractor Application Process 
Approved Vendors that wish to submit projects into the Equity Eligible Contractor (“EEC”) category 
must first apply to be certified as an EEC. They may do so in conjunction with their Approved Vendor 
application or at any time after submitting their initial Approved Vendor registration.  In order to 
streamline the process for a new program participant to become a certified EEC and Approved 
Vendor, the Agency and the Program Administrator will include the EEC certification document in 
the Approved Vendor application.  This will help prevent an EEC-qualifying applicant from missing 
an essential step that could affect the Approved Vendor’s ability to participate in the Equity Eligible 
Contractor category.362 
If  the  Approved  Vendor  is  organized  as  a  corporation,  general  partnership,  limited  liability 
partnership,  limited  liability  company,  or  limited  partnership,  the  applicant  will  be  asked  to 
designate which owners, partners, or proprietors meet the EEC eligibility criteria. Similarly, if the 
Approved Vendor is organized as a non-profit, the applicant will be asked to provide the board 
membership of the non-profit and designate which board members meet the EEC eligibility criteria. 
However, if the Approved Vendor is a sole proprietor, no additional designations are required. 
An Approved Vendor can qualify for an EEC certification by having status under at least one of the 
following four categories:  
•  Persons  who graduated from or  are current  or former  participants in  the  Clean  Jobs 
Workforce Network Program, the Clean Energy Contractor Incubator Program, the Illinois 
Climate  Works  Preapprenticeship  Program,  Returning  Residents  Clean  Jobs  Training 
Program, or the Clean Energy Primes Contractor Accelerator Program, and the solar training 
pipeline and multi-cultural jobs program created in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of Section 
16-108.12 of the Public Utilities Act 
•  Persons who are graduates of or currently enrolled in the foster care system 
•  Persons who were formerly incarcerated 
•  Persons whose primary residence is in an equity investment eligible community.363 
EEC applicants will be required to complete an EEC certification in addition to the general Approved 
Vendor attestation and application. This certification must be completed by each owner or board 
member in the organization used to establish EEC status. 
The applicant will be asked if it would like to be identified as an Equity Eligible Contractor on the 
public list of Approved Vendors on the illinoisabp.com and illinoisshines.com web sites; willingness 
to be publicly identified as an Equity Eligible Contractor on those sites is not required for maintaining 
EEC status. 
All certified EEC Approved Vendors will be listed on public project application reports and potential 
other public reports. 
 
362 See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 71. 
363 Equity investment eligible communities are defined as 1) R3 Areas as established pursuant to the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, and 
2) Environmental Justice Communities as established through Illinois Solar for All Program. For maps and address lookup tools for these 
two areas see: https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility and https://www.illinoissfa.com/environmental-justice-communities/ respectively.

As part of the EEC certification process, the Program Administrator may follow up with the applicant 
with  additional  questions  to  clarify  EEC  eligibility  and  reserves  the  right  to  seek  additional 
information or other documents to confirm EEC eligibility. 
7.8. Approved Vendor Designees 
In the First Revised Plan, the Agency created a new requirement for Approved Vendor Designees, 
requiring that Designees must register with the program and be listed on the program websites (both 
www.illinoisabp.com and www.illinoisshines.com) along with the Approved Vendor(s) with whom 
they are working. Registration also requires the assent of the Approved Vendor(s), and can be 
withdrawn by an Approved Vendor working with the Designee at its discretion, or by the IPA or 
Program  Administrator  if  the  Designee  is  found  to  have  violated  program  guidelines  and  is 
suspended or has its registration terminated. As used herein, by “Designee,” the Agency is referring 
to  third-party  (i.e.,  non-Approved  Vendor)  entities  that  have  direct  interaction  with  end-use 
customers.  This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  installers,  marketing  firms,  lead  generators, 
community solar subscription management firms, and sales organizations. The Agency reserves the 
right to add additional categories as needed.  
7.8.1.  Designee Registration 
Registration encompasses the Designee’s provision of contact information, acknowledgment of the 
business  relationship  with  the  Approved  Vendor,  and  identification  of  the  categories  of  the 
consumer-facing  services  provided.  Designees  must  also  indicate  if  they  are  minority-owned, 
woman-owned, veteran-owned, disability-owned or considered a small business and provide an 
estimate of the percentage of staff at time of registration who are women, minorities, veterans, or 
disabled.  
Additionally, a Designee is responsible for acknowledging that it will comply with all Program 
requirements applicable to installers or marketing agents, as applicable.  Since launching the 
Adjustable Block Program, the Agency has become aware of instances of violation of program 
guidelines by Approved Vendor Designees that may have been committed without the knowledge or 
control of the underlying Approved Vendor. Failure by a Designee to comply with applicable 
requirements could subject the Designee to suspension or termination from registration. If the 
Designee ignores a suspension (or termination) decision made by the Program Administrator and 
continues program activities nonetheless, any Approved Vendor that works with the Designee during 
that period will be subject to discipline.  Likewise, Approved Vendors found to be working with 
entities engaged in the proscribed activities that fail to register will be subject to discipline.   
Pursuant to the Commission’s Order in Docket No. 19-0995, Approved Vendors and their Designees 
were to register with the Program by December 10, 2020 to remain in compliance.364 
The purpose of this requirement is to increase transparency for the program. Potential customers 
will be able to verify that a company that reaches out to them is actually a program participant 
registered with the Program (and likewise be able to review if they are listed on the program’s 
Consumer Protection Database or the program’s Disciplinary Actions Report)365. While the Agency

had anticipated that smaller installers would work with Approved Vendors that are aggregators it 
has  become  clear  that  sales  and  marketing  of  solar  includes  a  variety  of  different  types  of 
organizations and that this variance can create market confusion.  
Approved Vendors are responsible for ensuring that their Designees register with the program 
(which includes an attestation by that Designee that the Designee agrees to abide by program terms 
and conditions), and Approved Vendors who fail to do so may be subject to disciplinary actions. This 
includes Designees contracted by or working for other Designees, sometimes referred to as “nested” 
designees. For example, for an Approved Vendor who has an installer serving as a Designee, and that 
installer hires a lead generation firm to assist in marketing for customer acquisition purposes, the 
Approved Vendor is responsible for ensuring that the lead generation firm (in addition to the 
installer) registers with the program. One possible benefit to Approved Vendors through this system 
will be that they will know what downstream firms are working with their direct Designees, and they 
may  be  able  to  better  monitor  those  firms’  behavior  (as  the  Approved  Vendor  is  ultimately 
responsible with conformance with program guidelines).   
The Agency also proposes that Designees go through an annual process to renew their registration, 
similar to the current renewal process for Approved Vendors. As part of this process, Designees will 
submit their training materials and certifications showing that their agents have been trained in 
accordance with program requirements.  
7.8.2.  Equity Eligible Contractor Designees  
As discussed in Section 7.4.6, a Designee may also register as an Equity Eligible Contractor. This 
registration does not qualify projects from those Designees to be eligible for the Equity Eligible 
Contractor category.  Instead, as described in Section 7.4.6, such Designees would need to work with 
an Approved Vendor that is EEC certified in order for their project to be eligible for the EEC category. 
EEC certified Designees may also work with an Approved Vendor that is not EEC certified, but this 
would make projects submitted by that non-EEC certified Approved Vendors ineligible for the EEC 
category. The application process for Designees will use the same criteria as described in Section 
7.7.2 for Approved Vendors. 
7.9. Project Requirements 
Projects that are eligible for the Adjustable Block Program must meet, at minimum, two sets of 
requirements. The first relates to the technical aspects of the system itself, and the second to the 
customer (and additionally to subscribers, in the case of community solar). The purpose of the first 
set of requirements is to ensure that high-quality systems are installed that will be capable of 
generating the expected quantity of RECs over the duration of the delivery contracts. The purpose of 
the second set of requirements is to ensure consumer protections. 
The Adjustable Block Program is intended to incentivize the development of new solar projects in 
Illinois.  Public Act 102-0662 further reinforced that intent through edits to Section 1-75(c)(1)(B) 
expressly stating that it “shall not comply with the annual percentage targets . . . by procuring 
renewable energy credits that are unlikely to lead to the development of new renewable resources.”   
As such, projects that were energized after June 1, 2017 and previously participated in the Agency’s 
2015-2017 utility distributed generation procurements or Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurement 
pursuant to Section 1-56(i) of the IPA Act – under which REC prices were established to facilitate the

successful development of those projects – will not be considered eligible for REC contracts under 
the Adjustable Block Program.   
7.9.1.  Technical System Requirements 
In this Section, the Agency outlines what technical information must to be submitted for each project. 
These standards apply for both distributed generation and community solar projects. The application 
process is described in more detail in Section 7.10. 
The technical system requirements are as follows:   
•  Information about the system location, and size, including but not limited to 
o  A description of the technical specifications of the main system components including 
the make and model, manufacturer, number (quantity) of panels, of panels and 
inverters and meters, array location (roof or ground mount), tilt, orientation  
o  Site map or other project details  
•  Proof of site control and/or host acknowledgement 
•  Project-specific estimate of REC production during the delivery term using PV Watts or a 
similar tool 
•  For distributed generation systems over 25 kW, an interconnection agreement signed by both 
the interconnecting utility and the interconnecting customer366  
•  For community solar systems, a Certificate of Completion or Permission to Operate from the 
interconnecting utility will continue to be required at the Part II application. An executed 
interconnection agreement will no longer be required at the Part I application for community 
solar projects.367  
•  For ground mounted systems over 250 kW, a land use permit, when applicable, from the 
Authority Having Jurisdiction (“AHJ”) over the project. In the event a land use permit is not 
applicable, written confirmation from the AHJ that no permit is required must be provided. 
•  For systems that include a battery, a detailed schematic showing that either only solar 
generated power can be used to charge the battery or that the battery’s output does not run 
through the meter used to measure solar output. 
In the Initial Plan, the Agency required that “[f]or systems over 25 kW, evidence of having obtained 
all non-ministerial permits that, according to the commercially reasonable investigation of the 
Approved Vendor, are necessary to the project at the time of application to the Adjustable Block 
program.” While the Agency no longer requires this provision (other than as specified above for land 
use permits), failure to obtain permits is a developer risk and one which the Agency believes likely 
would not allow for the invoking of force majeure provisions applicable to failing to meet contractual 
obligations. 
For systems that have been energized prior to application, the following information will also be 
required: 
 
366 The Adjustable Block Program now provides for separate categories for systems up to 25 kW, and greater than 25 kW and up to 5,000 
kW, and for the purposes of the requirements related to each project, the Agency has determined that this 25 kW breakpoint is the 
appropriate for different levels for requirements. 
367 However, in approving this Plan, the Commission directed the Agency to adjust scoring for the Traditional Community Solar category 
to encourage the participation of projects with a valid, executed interconnection agreement.  See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated 
July 14, 2022 at 58-60.  This scoring element does not apply to community solar projects which apply through the Community-Driven 
Community Solar, Equity Eligible Contractor, or Public Schools categories.

•  GATS or M-RETS unit ID368 
•  Certificate of Completion of Interconnection  
•  Photographic documentation of the installation 
The Agency recognizes that there may be special situations where some portion of these documents 
may not be available (for example, some rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities may not 
have standardized interconnection documents). The Agency will consider alternative documentation 
to demonstrate completion of interconnection in those situations.  
7.9.2.  Metering Requirements 
In developing the Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurements that took place in 2015 and 2016, the 
Agency developed a metering standard369 that is now used for the Adjustable Block Program. That 
standard has been updated to reflect changes in M-RETS metering requirements that harmonize with 
GATS standards and to clarify the use of inverters with integrated meters. The current standard 
applicable to systems registered in either PJM-GATS or M-RETS is as follows: 
•  Systems 25 kW and over must utilize a new meter that meets ANSI C.12 standards. Inverters 
with integrated ANSI C.12 compliant production meters are allowed with a specification 
sheet showing this standard has been met. The inverter must be UL-certified and must 
include either a digital or web-based output display.  
•  Systems over 10 kW and up to 25 kW in size utilize a meter that meets ANSI C.12 standards. 
Meters that are refurbished (and certified by the meter supplier) are allowed. Inverters with 
integrated ANSI C.12 compliant production meters are allowed with a specification sheet 
showing this standard has been met. The inverter must be UL-certified and must include 
either a digital or web-based output display. 
•  Systems of 10 kW in size and below must utilize either a meter that is accurate to +/‐ 5% 
(including  refurbished  and  certified  meters),  or  an  inverter  that  is  specified  by  the 
manufacturer to be accurate to +/‐5%.  The inverter must be UL‐certified and must include 
either a digital or web‐based output display. 
In responses to Request for Comments after the Agency’s workshops for the development of the 
Initial Plan,370 several commenters suggested allowing production estimates for smaller systems. A 
production estimate consists of GATS automatically generating RECs for a system based on the 
system size and engineering modeling of expected kilowatt hour generation. Production estimates 
do not require the system owner (or aggregator) to provide ongoing data to GATS.  While several 
states do allow production estimates for smaller systems, because production estimates do not 
require any actual data being transmitted to the tracking system to verify production, production 
estimates could be problematic as there would be no way to verify the system’s ongoing operation. 
By contrast, a meter read (from either a meter, or an inverter output) only needs to be submitted 
once per year to GATS.  The Agency thus does not allow production estimates for the Adjustable Block 
Program or the Illinois Solar for All Program.  
 
368 GATS or M-RETS registration must be complete and unit ID verifiable through GATS or M-RETS public reports.

195,203,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Given the upfront payments for RECs paired with the 15- or 20-year requirement for RECs to be 
delivered, the Agency believes that receiving actual data on system performance is essential to 
ensuring the integrity of the RPS, and having meter reads as infrequent as annually (although they 
could be as frequently as monthly) appropriately balances the need for accurate data and the 
compliance burdens on the system operators. Therefore, in the Initial Plan required metered output 
for the generation of RECs, although the use of inverter readings for systems up to 10 kW were 
continued to be allowed.371 In other words, the metering standard developed for the Supplemental 
Photovoltaic Procurement was the metering standard for the Adjustable Block Program, with the 
caveat that meter reads were only required on an annual basis.  The Agency understands that as of 
January 1, 2020, M-RETS no longer required an ANSI C.12 certified revenue quality meter, so the 
standards previously applicable for projects registered in GATS are now also applicable to projects 
registered in M-RETS. 
Additionally, in Docket No. 17-0838, questions were raised regarding the applicability of these 
metering standards to DC-based technologies.  In its Order approving the Initial Plan, the Commission 
sought for the IPA to “ensure that its Plan does not inadvertently prohibit participation from systems 
that do not convert the DC electricity produced to AC electricity,” with any resulting resolution to be 
presented to the Commission “before or in the 2019 Plan update.”  The IPA thus endeavored to work 
with stakeholders on solutions for facilitating permissible participation in the Adjustable Block 
Program from DC-based systems.372   
After approval of the Initial Plan, the Agency communicated regularly and deliberately with industry 
stakeholders who were seeking to coordinate and obtain ANSI approval of a new DC metering 
standard. However, the Agency has not received any subsequent input from such stakeholders and 
understands that this standard was finalized in of March 2021.373 The Agency has not reviewed the 
applicability or relevance of this standard to its programs, nor has it received any expressions of 
interest in systems metered in this manner. Should the Agency become aware of interest in DC-based 
metering  projects, it  will  initiate  a stakeholder feedback  process  to establish  appropriate  DC 
metering standards.   
7.9.3.  System Optimization  
The Agency added information to the Illinois Shines website in 2021 to educate customers and 
potential customers about optimal system design, and to provide information about typical ranges 
for specifications of solar photovoltaic systems participating in the Adjustable Block Program.374 The 
Agency plans to update the Distributed Generation Brochure and/or Disclosure Form following the 
approval of this 2022 Long-Term Plan and is contemplating inclusion of a reference to this resource 
therein. The Agency is also contemplating the development of additional educational materials to 
ensure that customers are aware of optimal specifications for a photovoltaic system in Illinois.   
For more information regarding consumer protections and strategies to ensure optimal system 
specifications are known to consumers, please see Chapter 9 of this Plan.  
 
371 The Agency notes that while using an inverter rather than a meter may save on installation costs, if the inverter were to suffer a system 
failure and lose data, no RECs could be created. A meter may be a more reliable way to ensure REC creation.

7.9.4.  Co-location of Community Renewable Generation Projects 
Co-location of projects occurs when multiple projects are located adjacent to each other, perhaps 
using the same point of interconnection.  Co-located projects can be structured to maximize income 
from incentives, such as by dividing up a larger project into smaller pieces that qualify for higher 
incentives.  Community Renewable Generation Projects are defined in the Act as being smaller than 
or equal to 5,000 kW, and for photovoltaic projects, the Adjustable Block Program includes adders 
for smaller projects.  Co-location strategies could therefore result in the gaming of incentives.  
Minnesota offers two points of experience with the issue of co-location, for both community wind 
and community solar.  Under both policies, larger projects were structured as a series of smaller 
projects to qualify for higher incentives, undermining the legislative intent of promoting distributed, 
community-owned projects.  A 30 MW wind project, owned by 15 corporate entities with the same 
owners, was developed under the Minnesota Community-Based Energy Development (C-BED) tariff 
program, which was intended to encourage community-owned wind projects of 2 MW or less.  That 
program was reformed in 2003 to be more prescriptive, limiting ownership to Minnesota residents, 
with a single owner limited to a 15% share of a project.375 
The development of the Minnesota Community Solar Gardens policy led to a similar problem.  While 
the legislature capped project size at 1 MW, it did not address co-location issues. As a result, 15 co-
located, aggregated projects were proposed between 10 and 20 MW, three between 20 and 30 MW, 
and two in the 30 to 50 MW range.  One developer, Sunrise Energy Ventures, filed applications for 
100 projects within the first hour of the program.  When the state Public Utilities Commission (“PUC”) 
imposed co-location caps of 5 MW for projects with filed applications and 1 MW for newly proposed 
projects, Sunrise appealed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals.  The Court, however, affirmed the PUC’s 
decision to implement caps.376  
While co-location can undermine the concept of smaller and more geographically diffuse projects, it 
can  also  capture  economies  of  scale  from  larger  projects:  large,  available  parcels  with  good 
interconnection points can be low-cost and efficient ways to develop large amounts of renewables 
quickly. Low development costs could help compensate for the higher marketing and customer 
acquisition costs of community renewable generation and provide greater benefits to low-income 
customers.  Also, different owners might apply to develop completely distinct projects at different 
times, that just happen to be on adjacent parcels; restrictive rules would limit the development of 
especially attractive parcels of land. 
Public Act 102-0662 added a new provision related to the co-location of community solar projects, 
“projects shall not be colocated with one or more other community renewable generation projects, 
as defined in the Agency's first revised long-term renewable resources procurement plan approved 
by the Commission on February 18, 2020, such that the aggregate nameplate capacity exceeds 5,000 
kilowatts.”377

As the maximum size for community solar projects is now 5 MW, this would appear to preclude the 
co-location of 5 MW community solar projects and only allow for the co-location of smaller projects. 
The following co-location standard reflects that definition of co-location updated to account for the 
maximum size:378 
•  No Approved Vendor may apply to the Adjustable Block Program for more than 5 MW of 
Community Solar projects on the same or contiguous parcels (with each “parcel” of land 
defined by the County the parcel is located in).  
•  A parcel of land may not have been divided into multiple parcels in the two years prior to the 
project application in order to circumvent this policy. If a parcel has been divided within that 
time period, the requirement will apply to the boundaries of the larger parcel prior to its 
division.  
•  If there are multiple projects owned or developed by a single entity (or its affiliates) located 
on one parcel of land, or on contiguous parcels of land, any size-based adders will be based 
on the total size of the projects owned or developed on the contiguous parcels by that single 
entity or its affiliates. Furthermore, the total combined size of projects owned or developed 
by a single entity (or its affiliates) on contiguous parcels of land may not be more than 5 MW.  
o  “Affiliate” means, with respect to any entity, any other entity that, directly, or 
indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under 
common control with each other or a third entity. “Control” means the possession, 
directly or indirectly, of the power to direct the management and policies of an entity, 
whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. 
Affiliates may not have shared sales or revenue-sharing arrangements, or common 
debt and equity financing arrangements.  
o  “Contiguous” means touching along a boundary or a point. For example, parcels 
touching along a boundary are contiguous, as are parcels that meet only at a corner. 
Parcels, however near to each other, that are separated by a third parcel and do not 
touch along a boundary, or a point are not contiguous.  
•  Projects owned or developed by separate entities (meaning that that they are not affiliates) 
may  be  located  on  contiguous  parcels.  If  there  is  a  naturally  good  location  from  an 
interconnection standpoint, one owner should not be allowed to prevent another owner from 
developing a project in that location.  
•  Projects must have separate interconnection points. 
7.9.5.  Eligibility of Projects Located in Rural Electric Cooperatives and 
Municipal Utilities 
The definition of community renewable generation projects specifically mentions rural electric 
cooperatives and municipal utilities,379 but does not explicitly include or exclude them from any 
program or procurement to be run by the Agency. Moreover, the definition includes the concept of 
that project having “subscribers,” a term which in turn has a definition that defines such “subscribers” 
 
378 A reference to “competitive procurements” has also been removed as it would have applied to the now repealed Illinois Solar for All 
Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Procurement. 
379 See 20 ILCS 3855/1-10 (""’Community renewable generation project’ means an electric generating facility that is . . . interconnected at 
the distribution system level of an electric utility as defined in this Section, a municipal utility as defined in this Section that owns or 
operates electric distribution facilities, a public utility as defined in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act, or an electric cooperative, as 
defined in Section 3-119 of the Public Utilities Act”).

as “tak[ing] delivery service from an electric utility,” which as defined in the IPA Act does not include 
cooperative and municipal utilities.380 This resulted in ambiguity around whether a community 
renewable  generation  project  can  be  located  within  the  service  territory  of  a  rural  electric 
cooperative or a municipal utility.  
The Agency recognized the General Assembly’s choice expressly to include those entities in defining 
“community renewable generation projects”—a term only used in the IPA Act in connection with the 
Agency’s  community  renewable  generation  program—and  proposed  in  its  Initial  Plan  that 
community renewable generation projects (including community solar) located in these service 
territories should, if possible, be eligible for the Adjustable Block Program and Illinois Solar for All 
Program (where applicable).   
The  status  of  community  renewable  generation  projects  and  distributed  renewable  energy 
generation devices located in the service territories of rural electric cooperatives, municipal electric 
utilities, and Mt. Carmel Public Utility Company was a contested issue in Docket No. 17-0838.   The 
Commission’s Final Order in that proceeding determined that the Agency’s Initial Plan correctly 
allowed  the  participation  of  these  projects  in  the  Adjustable  Block  Program,  the  Community 
Renewable  Generation  Program,  and  the  Illinois  Solar  for  All  Program.381  In  June  2018, 
Commonwealth Edison Company filed a petition seeking review of that determination (i.e., an 
appeal) with the state’s Second District Appellate Court, case number 2-18-0504. On May 2, 2019, the 
Appellate Court affirmed the ICC’s decision in this regard.  On July 11, 2019, ComEd filed a Petition 
for Leave to Appeal, No. 124898, with the Supreme Court of Illinois. It was denied on September 25, 
2019, resolving this issue and clarifying that projects in the service territories of rural electric 
cooperatives, municipal electric utilities, and Mt. Carmel Public Utility Company, are indeed eligible 
to receive REC delivery contracts under the Adjustable Block Program.  
As mentioned above, there are already at least three community solar offerings by or within rural 
electric cooperatives that are not part of the Adjustable Block Program.  Illinois’ first community solar 
project was a 126 kW installation in Elizabeth, Illinois, built by Jo Carroll Energy in December 2014.382 
That project allows Jo Carroll customers to buy individual panels in the 460-panel ground-mounted 
system, with the energy produced credited against their bills.  Prairie Power sells kWh blocks of solar 
power to customers of its 10 distribution cooperatives through the Bright Options Solar program. 
The program is supplied by two 500 kW solar installations near Shelbyville and Astoria, both built in 
2015.383 Neither of these projects would be eligible to participate in the Adjustable Block Program 
because they were energized prior to June 1, 2017, but they indicate that rural electric cooperatives 
have thus far been the leaders in community solar in Illinois. Several proposed community solar 
projects that would be located within the Jo Carroll Energy service territory applied to the Adjustable 
 
380 Specifically, Section 1-10 of the IPA Act defines an electric utility as having “the same definition as found in Section 16-102 of the Public 
Utilities Act,” which is “a public utility, as defined in Section 3-105 of this Act, that has a franchise, license, permit or right to furnish or sell 
electricity to retail customers within a service area.”  220 ILCS 5/16-102.  Section 3-105 of the PUA in turn defines “public utility” to 
expressly exclude “public utilities that are owned and operated by any political subdivision, public institution of higher education or 
municipal corporation of this State, or public utilities that are owned by such political subdivision, public institution of higher education, 
or municipal corporation and operated by any of its lessees or operating agents” as well as “electric cooperatives as defined in Section 3-
119” of the PUA.  220 ILCS 5/3-105.

Block Program, and one – the Apple Canyon Lake Solar Farm – was allocated a REC contract via the 
April 10, 2019 lottery and is currently in operation. 
The 2022 Plan proposed no changes to the standard for allowing community renewable generation 
projects in the service territories of rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities to participate 
in the Agency’s programs or procurements from the standard approved by the ICC in the Initial Plan. 
This standard, outlined below, may require actions be taken by the rural electric cooperative or 
municipal utility. As entities not regulated by the state, they are free to choose whether to take these 
actions, but should they choose not to, then the residents and businesses within their service 
territories would not benefit from receiving revenue through these programs for its RECs, and thus 
the economics of such projects may not be as attractive to developers or subscribers. 
The requirements for participation for a community renewable generation project located in a rural 
electric cooperative or municipal utility follow from those required in the Act for electric utilities: 
•  Be capable of “credit[ing] the value of electricity generated by the facility to the subscribers 
of  the  facility.”384  This  can  be  accomplished  through  offering  “virtual  net  metering” 
substantially similar to the provisions contained in Section 16-107.5(l) of the Public Utilities 
Act.385 The value of electricity credited must be at no lower than the subscriber’s supply 
rate.386 
•  Provide a monetary credit to a subscriber's subsequent bill for service for the proportional 
output of a community renewable generation project attributable to that subscriber.387 
•  Purchase any unsubscribed energy from community renewable generation projects that are 
Qualifying Facilities (""QF"") under the electric utility's tariff for purchasing the output from 
QFs under Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.388 
Prior to a photovoltaic community renewable generation project applying for the Adjustable Block 
Program, or a community renewable generation project powered by other renewable technologies 
participating in the competitive procurement, the Approved Vendor shall obtain a certification 
addressed to the Agency that the rural electric cooperative or municipal utility has met these 
conditions from the subject cooperative or municipal utility. Absent this information, a project 
located in the service territory of that rural electric cooperative or municipal utility will not be 
allowed to participate.  All other programmatic requirements for community renewable generation 
projects (e.g., size limits, co-location, consumer protections) would apply to projects located in rural 
electric cooperatives or municipal utility service territories. For the purposes of rural electric 
cooperatives,  these  requirements  apply  at  the  distribution  cooperative  level,  rather  than  for 
generation and transmission cooperatives (which do not directly interact with retail customers).  
 
384 See definition of “Community Renewable Generation Facility” in 20 ILCS 3855/1-10. 
385 See 220 ILCS 5/16-107.5(l). 
386 If the municipal utility or rural electric cooperative does not have unbundled rates (e.g., separate line items for delivery services and 
electricity supply) then the applicable municipal utility or rural electric cooperative must indicate the portion of the bundled rate that 
reasonably correlates to the cost of electricity supply service.

7.9.6.  Specific Requirements for Community Solar 
Community Renewable Generation remains a developing concept in Illinois. It is intended to allow 
consumers to participate in renewable energy generation even if they are unable to have an on-site 
system at their home or business, and to offer a more direct connection to the benefits of renewable 
energy than signing up for a renewable energy retail supply offer from an Alternative Retail Electric 
Supplier (where information about the specific sources, costs, and benefits of the renewable energy 
and the underlying generating system(s) may not be readily available).  
Community, or “shared,” renewable energy is growing nationally, most often in conjunction with 
solar power. The Solar Energy Industries Association reports that nearly 3,100 MW of community 
solar had been developed in the United States through 2020.389 
Many policy issues that have been debated in other states are resolved in Illinois the law itself, 
including elements of project size, ownership structures, and the minimum number and type of 
subscribers. In addition to explaining those aspects of Illinois law, within this Section 6.9.6 and the 
following subsections, the Agency outlines the terms and conditions for the Community Renewable 
Generation Program that are not prescribed by the IPA Act. 
7.9.6.1.  Subscriber Requirements 
With community renewable generation still an emerging concept, the level of consumer interest and 
the most viable business models remain to be determined.  Most offers the Agency has observed in 
the market to date are simply cost savings offers under which the customer pays a lower per kilowatt 
hour fee for a community solar subscription than the customer receives as a per kilowatt hour credit 
through net metering.  In general, Agency seeks to allow creativity and flexibility in developing 
projects and creating unique value propositions for subscribers, while at the same time ensuring 
basic consumer protections for subscribers to a community renewable generation project. These 
considerations will apply for all types of community solar projects. 
7.9.6.2.  Small Subscriber Participation 
In the development of the Initial Long-Term Plan to address the requirement that the Agency propose 
terms and conditions that “ensure robust participation opportunities for residential and small 
commercial customers and those who cannot install renewable energy on their own properties,”390 
the Agency defined small subscribers as “residential and small commercial customers” so long as 
their subscription size is below 25 kW.  While the Agency did not require a minimum participation 
level for small subscribers, the initial lottery for community solar project selection included a first 
phase for projects that committed to serving at least 50% small subscribers, and REC pricing included 
adders for reaching certain levels of small subscriber participation.  
Public  Act  102-0662  codified  this  level  of  small  subscriber  participation  with  Section  1-
75(c)(1)(K)(iii)(2) now requiring “projects shall have subscriptions of 25 kW or less for at least 50% 
of the facility's nameplate capacity and the Agency shall price the renewable energy credits with that 
as a factor.” As this is not a hard minimum for small subscriber participation, the REC prices for 
community solar projects now include consideration of the costs of acquiring and maintain small

subscribers rather than having them as a separate adder, as explained above in Section 7.5.6 and 
approved by the Commission in Docket No. 22-0231.391 
7.9.6.3.  Utility Responsibilities  
While the Agency, through the Adjustable Block Program and competitive procurements, will be 
responsible for the procurement of RECs from community renewable generation projects, it is not 
responsible for all aspects of a successful program. There are additional key aspects of making 
community renewable generation projects successful that fall outside of the control of the Agency: 
•  The crediting of the value of energy through net metering 
•  Ensuring the portability and transferability of subscriptions within a utility service territory. 
The Agency will work with system owners and developers as well as the utilities (and with rural 
electric cooperatives and municipal utilities should they choose to participate) to reflect these 
aspects in  the  terms, conditions,  and  operational  aspects of  the  programs and  procurements 
conducted by the Agency. The Agency will also coordinate with the utilities for the sharing of any 
pertinent data and information that each party collects and maintains regarding projects and 
subscriptions. 
Under the provisions of P.A. 99-0906, the Commission approved tariffs for ComEd, Ameren Illinois 
and  MidAmerican  on September 27, 2017,  which  the  Agency  understands complied  with  the 
requirements  of  Section  16-107.5  of  PUA  in  terms  of  crediting  to  subscribers  and  with  the 
requirements of and Section 1-75(c)(1)(N) of the IPA Act in terms of subscription portability. 
Public Act 102-0662, significantly updated the net metering requirements for the utilities and set a 
deadline for new tariffs to be filed within 90 days and approved by the Commission within 120 days 
of the effective date of Public Act 102-0662.392   
First and foremost under the changes to Section 16-107.5 of the PUA is the addition of the provision 
that “only electric utilities serving more than 200,000 customers as of January 1, 2021 shall provide 
net metering for projects that are eligible for subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) and have 
energized after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly[.]”393   
Subparagraph (C)(1) of Section 16-107.5(l) of the PUA identifies those net metering projects as 
“subscriptions to community solar renewable generation projects, including community renewable 
generation projects on the customer’s side of the billing meter of a host facility and partially used for 
the customer’s own load.”  As a result of these changes and in conjunction with the requirement that 
updated tariffs be filed with the Commission 90 days after the effective date of 102-0662, on 
December 14, 2021, MidAmerican filed a Petition for Special Permission to put updated tariffs into 
effect on less than 45 days’ notice with changes to its Rate NMS – Net Metering for Subscribers to 
Community Renewable Generation Projects (Rate NMS).  These proposed revisions reflect the fact 
that MidAmerican, as an electric utility serving less than 200,000 customers on January 1, 2021, is no 
longer required to offer community solar subscription net metering for community renewable 
generation projects built after September 15, 2021.  Based upon the recommendation of ICC Staff, the

Commission granted special permission to allow these tariff changes at its Regular Open Meeting on 
January 5, 2022.394 
Other changes to Section 16-107.5 of the PUA pursuant to P.A. 102-0662 resolve questions regarding 
the calculation of net metering credits and issues which require that electricity providers provide 
credits “that include at least energy supply, capacity, transmission, and, if applicable, the purchased 
energy adjustment.”395  Additionally, electric utilities serving more than 200,000 customers as of 
January 1, 2021 (i.e., ComEd and Ameren) shall provide the subscription credits on the customer’s 
monthly utility bill at the utility’s total price to compare equal to the subscriber’s share of the 
production of electricity from the project, including for customers on payment plans or participating 
in budget billing programs.396  ARES providing electric supply to a subscriber not subject to Sections 
16-108.18 and 16-1118 of the PUA shall likewise provide the monetary credits to the subscriber’s 
subsequent bill.  Commonwealth Edison and Ameren Illinois have filed multiple updated tariffs with 
the Commission, many of which remain under review or consideration for rehearing.397 
7.10.  Application Process 
The following section outlines the process and procedure that Approved Vendors will use to submit 
projects to the Program Administrator for review and approval, as well as how projects, once 
approved, will be placed into contracts with the utilities. 
7.10.1.  Batches  
Under the Initial Plan, Approved Vendors were required to submit projects bundled into batches. For 
the First Revised Plan, the Agency proposed (and the Commission approved) a simplification of the 
batch process. For a new Approved Vendor, there remains the requirement for a submittal of a first 
batch of at least 100 kW of projects, and that 75% of the capacity of that batch must be verified to be 
approved. Approved Vendors are allowed to select which batches approved systems are placed into, 
so that they can better manage their financing portfolios.398 Once systems’ Part I applications are 
verified, and before they are sent to the Commission for approval, an Approved Vendor will be 
consulted and given the opportunity to specify how its verified systems are batched, so long as those 
batches of verified systems are at least 100 kW in size.   
For established Approved Vendors that have had a contract approved by the Commission and do not 
desire to assemble batches into portfolios in this way, projects may be submitted on a rolling basis, 
and as projects are verified, the Program Administrator will place them into new batches that will 
result in a contract and/or new confirmations with one utility.  
Utilities may use one master agreement with multiple confirmations (one confirmation per batch) 
from an Approved Vendor, rather than having multiple contracts with the same vendor.399 The

systems within the batch/confirmation will be listed on a schedule (or product order) attached to the 
contract and may not be substituted once approved.  
A batch may contain projects in different groups/blocks (and thus with different prices) and with 
different adders. The price for the RECs for each system will be based on the price available within 
the applicable block on the date of the submittal. The failure of any system to be developed (and thus 
the forfeiture of any collateral associated with that specific system) will not impact any of the other 
systems on the same schedule, although the Agency will monitor system failure rates across 
Approved Vendors. Approved Vendors with high failure rates may be required to provide additional 
information to the Agency for subsequent applications.  
The Program Administrator will determine which utility will serve as the counterparty for each 
contract. While a batch may contain projects in multiple utility service territories, the Program 
Administrator will strive to assign contracts to the utility where the bulk of the projects are located 
but may not always be able to do so because the Program Administrator will also consider how 
assigning contracts to each utility will allow each utility to meet its pro-rata share of the RPS REC 
targets and available RPS funding. The REC price for each system will be based on the applicable 
Group for that system’s physical location, and not based on the identity of the counterparty utility to 
that contract.  
After a batch of projects is created by the Procurement Administrator, the number of RECs to be 
delivered annually and payment amount(s) for the batch will be provided to the utility by the 
Program Administrator for purposes of contract/confirmation preparation (i.e., the utilities will 
track the RECs by batch rather than by individual unit). Utilities will send a report of RECs delivered 
by batch semi-annually to the Program Administrator.400 
7.10.2.  Systems below 25 kW  
In responses to the Request for Comments that the Agency issued in June 2017, several commenters 
recommended that systems under 25 kW only be submitted once they are completed and energized, 
to minimize administrative burdens and avoid project attrition. While the Agency is sympathetic to 
those ideas, it did not adopt that recommendation for several reasons. It may be difficult, or 
impossible, to have appropriate consumer protections if the Agency sees information about a system 
only after it is completed. Preventing problematic behavior (such as deceptive information about 
system costs and payback times) should be done prior to the homeowner or business paying for the 
system; that would not be the case if systems apply only after being energized.  
To be clear, the Program does not prohibit an Approved Vendor from submitting a “new” system that 
has already been energized, but the Approved Vendor will have to assume the risk that the system 
may not meet the required terms and conditions and could be rejected and thus not be included in a 
contract for the purchase of the system’s RECs. A system that is rejected could be resubmitted at a 
later date if the deficiencies are cured, but the Agency cautions that some deficiencies may be difficult 
or  impossible  to  cure  (particularly  when  related  to  ensuring  consumer  protections  from  the 
beginning of the project’s life).401 
 
400 See id.   
401 See Section 6.13 of the Revised Long-Term Plan for further discussion of consumer protections applicable to systems energized after 
June 1, 2017 but before consumer protection requirements are finalized.

204,212,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
7.10.3.  Application Fee 
For each project, a non-refundable application fee must be paid to the Program Administrator or the 
Agency of $10 per kW, not to exceed $5,000 per project. This fee will be used to offset the 
administrative costs of running the program and will decrease the administrative fees that would 
otherwise be taken from the utility RPS budgets. 
7.10.4.  Project Review  
The Program Administrator reviews project applications received by the Program and as needed, 
requests  additional  information  from  the  Approved  Vendor  in  order  to  verify  the  submitted 
information and approve the project. An Approved Vendor will be given up to two weeks to cure 
deficiencies in  an  application.  If  deficiencies cannot  be  cured,  the  project  application  will  be 
withdrawn. If the Approved Vendor can subsequently address the deficiencies, the Approved Vendor 
can resubmit the project (with a new application fee). For Approved Vendors participating in the 
proposed training/mentorship program described in Section 7.2, as well as all Equity Eligible 
Contractor  qualified  Approved  Vendors  (regardless  of  their  participation  in  the  training  and 
mentorship program), new application fees will be waived if the resubmittal happens within three 
months of the initial application being withdrawn.402 
For an initial 100 kW batch, if, after any attempts to cure deficiencies have been made, projects 
representing at least 75% of the capacity of the batch are reviewed and approved by the Program 
Administrator, that batch will included in a contract presented to the Commission for approval. For 
established Approved Vendors, on a rolling basis in anticipation of the next scheduled Commission 
meeting, the Program Administrator will place verified projects for each Approved Vendor into 
batches for assignment to a counterparty utility, and prepare the confirmation information (and, in 
that case, master agreement information, if it is the Approved Vendor’s first batch) or the contract 
information related to that batch.403   
The  Program  Administrator  will  then  submit  the  contract  information  for  the  batch  to  the 
Commission for approval. The Program Administrator will simultaneously forward the contract 
information to the applicable utility.404 
An Approved Vendor that repeatedly submits deficient or noncompliant project applications may be 
subject to having its Approved Vendor status reviewed, and possibly suspended or terminated. 
7.10.5.  Converting System Size into REC Quantities 
For each approved system, the Program Administrator will calculate a 15 or 20-year REC payment 
amount and obligation level, and that payment amount and delivery obligation will be included in the 
REC Contract. Approved Vendors will have the option of using a PVWatts calculated capacity factor 
(stated relative to a system’s nameplate capacity in AC rating) automatically computed by the 
application platform or proposing an alternative capacity factor based upon an analysis conducted 
using an equivalent tool. Alternative capacity factors may be proposed as part of each system’s 
application and will be subject to review and approval by the Program Administrator. Systems using 
bifacial panels must submit an alternative capacity factor subject to review and approval by the

Program Administrator. All capacity factors submitted must be for a system’s first year; as stated in 
Section  7.12.2  below,  annual  REC  delivery  commitments  will  incorporate  a  0.5%  per  year 
degradation factor. 
7.10.6.  Batch Contract Approval 
The Commission meets approximately every two weeks. The Program Administrator will strive to 
efficiently process approved projects and assign them to batches for submittal to the Commission. 
The Agency understands that Commission practice is that items for consideration by the Commission 
must be submitted to be placed on its open meeting agenda at least 8 business days prior to each 
meeting.  
When the Program Administrator submits contract information to the Commission for approval, that 
submittal will include the Program Administrator’s recommendation for approval of the batch, with 
a summary of factors relevant to Plan compliance. (Projects that are not approved by the Program 
Administrator are not submitted to the Commission.) This process is similar to that required for 
approval of contracts under annual electricity procurement plans pursuant to Section 16-111.5(f) of 
the PUA, or contracts under the Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurement Plan pursuant to Section 1-
56(i)(5) of the Act.405  
Pursuant to the Initial Plan, the Agency worked with Commission Staff to develop a Staff Report that 
includes the standards that the Commissions should use in considering the approval of contracts and 
product orders within the ABP and ILSFA.406 The Commission approved the recommendations 
contained in the Staff Report on December 19, 2018. Upon approval of this Plan by the Commission, 
the Agency and Commission Staff will review and update that Staff Report if necessary. 
Once a batch is approved by the Commission, the applicable utility will execute the REC contract 
and/or product order, as applicable. The Approved Vendor will then be required to sign the contract 
or product order within seven business days of receiving it from the utility.407  Failure to sign the 
contract or product order may subject the Approved Vendor to discipline under the Program. 
Additionally, when a contract or product order is not executed by the Approved Vendor within the 
seven business days after receipt, the constituent projects will be considered removed from the 
Program, with the option to re-apply later, subject to payment of a new application fee and available 
open block capacity (and subject to the applicant’s Approved Vendor status not having been revoked 
due to the product order’s non-execution). A collateral requirement to be held by the utility equal to 
5% of the total contract value will be required in the form of either cash or a letter of credit with the 
utility within 30 business days of Commission approval of the contract.  
In the First Revised Plan, the Agency recommended, and the Commission approved a clarification to 
the collateral withholding process to be reflected in the updated REC contract (as discussed in Section 
7.14). In cases where collateral was posted through a letter of credit, the Approved Vendor may 
choose for the utility to withhold the collateral amount for each system from the last (or only, if a

distributed generation  system  of  25  kW  or  smaller  in  size)  REC  payment  in  exchange  for  a 
release/reduction of the letter of credit.408 
In the Initial Plan, the Agency provided an option to allow an Approved Vendor to be able to forgo 
posting collateral for a system that was already energized and instead have that collateral withheld 
from the REC payment. The intent of that provision was to allow systems that had been developed 
prior to the program launch to have a simplified process, recognizing of those systems’ absence of 
development risk. However, the Agency has observed that this process has had an unintended 
consequence of encouraging some Approved Vendors to submit projects only after their energization 
as a way of avoiding any collateral obligation. If the project does not apply until after it is built, 
enforcing and ensuring consumer protections (and other program requirements) becomes more 
challenging. Ultimately, consumers are better served if their project can be reviewed and approved 
by the program (and then submitted to the ICC for approval) prior to being built. For this reason, the 
Agency will require upfront collateral in all cases, including for energized systems under the new 
2021 REC Delivery Contracts utilized for program reopening in December 2021. 
Approved Vendors do not have the option to decline to post collateral within 30 business days once 
they have signed the contract. Failure to post collateral by the 30 business day deadline will violate 
the REC contract and may result in an Approved Vendor being suspended from further participation 
in the program. 
7.10.7.  Assignment of Projects 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(L)(x) of the IPA Act now expressly provides that “[c]ontracts may be assignable, 
but only to entities first deemed by the Agency to have met program terms and requirements 
applicable to direct program participation.”  In addition, “[i]n developing contracts for the delivery 
of renewable energy credits, the Agency shall be permitted to establish fees applicable to each 
contract assignment. 
Contracts or individual batches (but not individual projects that form a subset of a batch) are 
assignable. The assignee must agree to, and abide by, the applicable terms and conditions required 
of an Approved Vendor (or a Single Project Approved Vendor in the case of the assignment of a single 
project from a contract). Consistent with the Commission’s Order in Docket No. 17-0838, the assignor 
and the assignee will be required to notify the contracting utility of any assignment, and provide the 
utility with all pertinent financial, settlement and contact information.409  The assignor may be 
required to pay a fee to the contracting utility.  The Agency and its Program Administrator have 
generated form documents410 for use in accommodating the assignment process and will endeavor 
to cooperate with the assignor, assignee, and utility in updating Program records to accommodate 
the assignment. More specific project assignment terms and conditions (such as the of assignment 
 
408 This provision would not apply to cash collateral for the following reason. If a project had a total REC value of $100, $5 of collateral 
would be due. To swap the 5% collateral for a withheld payment, $100 in total payments ($95 of REC payments plus a return of $5 
collateral) would need to be made, leaving a balance held by the utility of $5, the same as before. On the other hand, if the collateral were 
a letter of credit, then a payment of $95 would eliminate the need for the Approved Vendor to maintain the letter of credit (or portion 
thereof) for the remaining life of the contract.

fees)  have  generally  been  handled  through  the  development  of  the  REC  delivery  contracts 
themselves, and the Agency proposes a continuation of that approach.   
For  waitlisted  projects,  projects  may  be  selected  off  a  waitlist  in  any  given  Group/category 
combination either when previously selected and approved projects drop out of the program, thus 
freeing up program capacity (with the project selected from the waitlist receiving the most recently 
available REC price), or when a new block of capacity is opened (and receive that block’s REC price). 
While projects on a waitlist are not yet under contract,411 an Approved Vendor may assign that 
project to another Approved Vendor, or the project itself may be sold, without penalty or impacting 
the project’s position on the waitlist.  An Approved Vendor must promptly notify the Program 
Administrator412 of that transfer and provide appropriate documentation.   
Projects that are developed by Approved Vendors certified as Equity Eligible Contractors and receive 
a REC contract through the EEC block of capacity may not assign those projects to an Approved 
Vendor that is not also a certified Equity Eligible Contractor for six years after the Part II verification 
date of the project. After six years from the Part II verification date has passed, this moratorium on 
assigning EEC projects to Approved Vendors that are not certified as an EEC is lifted. 
7.11.  Project Development Timeline and Extensions 
7.11.1.  Development Time Allowed 
Once a contract for a batch has been executed by the Approved Vendor and the utility, the next step 
is for projects not yet developed to be developed and energized. The following timelines are based 
upon the REC delivery contract execution date, such that any delays in processing and approving an 
application will not reduce the time available for development. 
•  Distributed generation projects will be given 18 months to be developed and energized. 
•  Community  solar  projects  will  be  given  24  months  to  be  developed,  energized,  and 
demonstrate that they have sufficient subscribers. 
A project that is not completed in the time allowed (plus any extensions granted) will be removed 
from the contract, and the REC volume associated with the project will be eliminated from the 
contract. The Approved Vendor will also forfeit the posted collateral associated with the project. Any 
forfeiture of collateral by the Approved Vendor under the REC contract will be considered to be 
returned to the utility’s available Renewable Resources Budget and will become available for REC 
delivery contracts for other projects.  
A project that is not completed in time and is removed from the contract may be subsequently re-
submitted by an Approved Vendor but will be treated like any other new system being submitted.   
In some instances, the developer of an Adjustable Block Program project may learn that development 
of the project is no longer feasible—whether due to financing falling through, the system host no 
longer wanting to move forward with the project, or myriad other circumstances.  Under the language 
of the 2019 REC delivery contract, such a system could not be removed from the contract until 
 
411 The allowances in this sentence also apply to a non-waitlisted Part I applicant project that has not yet been selected by the Program 
Administrator for a REC contract. 
412 For this Chapter, all references to the Program Administrator refer to the Program Administrator for the Adjustable Block Program. 
Discussion of the Program Administrator for the Illinois Solar for All Program can be found in Chapter 8.

contract requirements related to a Seller meeting the system’s energization deadline were not timely 
met, a contract violation which may not occur until over one year from the point at time in which the 
Seller learns that development is no longer feasible.   
Thus, in the First Revised Plan, the Agency sought Commission permission to allow the Seller to 
provide notification to the Buyer, the Agency, and the Commission that it is exercising its option 
allowing for a system’s removal from the contract because the Approved Vendor no longer wished to 
develop that system.  Under these circumstances, the Seller would forfeit the posted Performance 
Assurance applicable to the system.  Doing so allows the contract parties (the utility Buyer and 
Approved Vendor Seller) to no longer maintain a contractual obligation when performance is no 
longer intended, while also providing clarity to the Agency and its Program Administrator about the 
availability of new Program capacity through removal of a project from a REC contract.   This proposal 
was approved by the Commission in Docket No. 19-0995, and the Agency has since developed specific 
forms and procedures to effectuate this option for Sellers.413 
7.11.2.  Extensions 
Extensions to the energization deadline will be granted for the following circumstances. 
•  An indefinite extension will be granted if a system is electrically complete (ready to start 
generation), but the utility has not approved the interconnection.  The Approved Vendor must 
document that the interconnection approval request was made to the utility within 30 days 
of the system being electrically complete, yet not processed and approved. 
•  A 6-month extension will be granted for documented legal delays, including permitting 
delays. 
•  A 6-month extension will be granted upon payment of a refundable $25/kW extension fee, 
for distributed generation systems, and up to two 6-month extensions for community solar 
projects (the second extension is only for achieving the required subscriber rate, not for 
project completion and energization, and will require an additional refundable $25/kW fee). 
The extension fee(s) is payable to the contracting utility and would be refunded as part of the 
first (or only for systems up to 10 kW) REC payment. 
•  The Agency may also, but is not required to, approve extensions for demonstration of good 
cause.414 
7.11.3.  Project Completion and Energization 
The Approved Vendor will provide the Program Administrator with a status update on each project 
under development but not yet energized at least every six months and will inform the Agency of any 
significant changes to the system.415 For community solar projects, the update will include an update 
on the status of acquiring subscribers. The Agency and Program Administrator have developed a 
standardized form (including standard status categories to simplify reporting) for this purpose. 
 
413 See Docket No. 19-0995, Final Order dated February 18, 2020 at 80. 
414 Good cause extensions have been the primary means of allowing for extensions in energization deadlines due to COVID-19 related 
delays, as described extensively in Chapter 3.    
415 For systems under 25 kW, that status update is only be required for a system where there is a change in status (e.g., a project being 
completed, or canceled).

209,217,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Once a project is energized, the following information is required from the Approved Vendor for the 
Program Administrator to approve the final project as Energized for purposes of the REC delivery 
contract and authorize commencement of payment for RECs:  
•  Final system size 
•  Final system specific capacity factor and REC production estimate 
•  GATS or M-RETS unit ID416 
•  Certificate of Completion of Interconnection or comparable documentation417, 418 
•  Photographic documentation of the installation 
•  Disclosure of any changes to the system technical specifications that occurred between the 
initial application and the completion of the project 
•  Identity of the installer (must be a Qualified Person under Part 468 of the ICC’s Rules) 
•  Documentation of compliance with prevailing wage requirements, if applicable 
•  Demographic information related to the workforce constructing and installing the system 
Additional requirements may be published (such as through the Program Guidebook) by the Program 
Administrator if the Agency determines that such requirements are warranted, and the Program 
Administrator may reference other sources (such as public databases) to determine the accuracy of 
any submissions.  
If the final system size is larger than the proposed system size such that it would cause the system to 
change from the up to and including 25 kW category to the over-25 kW category, the payment terms 
will be adjusted from the full payment on energization to 15% on energization and the balance over 
the next six years. The price per REC will also be changed to the applicable REC price for the over 25 
kW category in effect at the time when the system is energized. 
For systems over 25 kW, the final REC price will be based on the final system size if that final system 
size would cause the REC price to remain the same or to decrease. A system that is developed at a 
size smaller than the original application will not be eligible for a higher REC price.  
The quantity of RECs used for payment calculations is based on the lesser of the RECs calculated 
based on the proposed (Part I) system size and capacity factor, and the RECs calculated based on the 
final (Part II) system size and capacity factor. The final capacity factor can be adjusted down from the 
initial capacity factor, but can only be increased from the original capacity factor upon satisfactory 
information submitted by the Approved Vendor that demonstrates modifications to the system 
design that justify an increase. This could include changes in capacity factor due to switches between 
tracking technology, non-tracking and tracking systems, and bifacial vs. standard module use.  In no 
case will the change in capacity factor allow for an increase in REC quantity from that approved at 
the Part I stage.  In this way, a system that is built smaller than planned will not benefit from excess 
REC payments that could result from purposefully submitting the project at a larger size than really 
intended. On the opposite side, if a project’s final system size is significantly larger than the planned 
system  size,  an  increase  in  the  payment  due  could  present  unexpected  budget  management 
challenges. An Approved Vendor has the option of canceling and resubmitting a system if the final 
 
416 GATS or M-RETS registration must be complete and unit ID verifiable through GATS or M-RETS public reports. 
417 Comparable documentation would only apply for a rural electric cooperative or municipal utility that does not provide a Certificate of 
Completion of Interconnection. 
418 Per Section 1-75(c)(1)(K) of the IPA Act, the date of final interconnection approval must be no earlier than June 1, 2017.

 ",7. Adjustable Block Program ,[],736,17,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf

size is larger than the proposed system to align the REC quantities or if it desires to have the system 
change from a distributed generation project to a community solar project, or vice versa. However, 
the applicable REC price upon resubmittal is the price of the block open at that time (and subject to 
any applicable waitlists), and not at the time of the original submittal. Because the Program 
Administrator will need to review the system design (due to the change in system size), a new 
application fee will be required. If a project is resubmitted, the collateral associated with the original 
system may be applied to the resubmitted system, if approved.  
While the Approved Vendor is the entity that receives REC payments, the terms of sharing that REC 
payment value with customers (completely, partially, or not at all; immediately or over time; directly 
or indirectly) or obligations associated with a system’s performance assurance payment are left to a 
customer and Approved Vendor (or customer and Designee) to work out between themselves prior 
to executing an agreement.  However, the clear failure to satisfy a contractual obligation to a customer 
may result in the violation of program requirements and disciplinary action under the program.   
The Agency reserves the right to request more information on an installation, and/or conduct on-site 
inspections/audits of projects to verify the quality of the installation and conformance with the 
project information submitted to the Agency.  Projects found not to conform with applicable 
installation standards and requirements, or projects found not to be consistent with information 
provided to the Agency will be subject to removal from the program if the deficiencies cannot be 
remedied. Likewise, Approved Vendors who repeatedly submit projects featuring application errors 
or inconsistencies with program requirements may be subject to suspension or termination of their 
Approved Vendor status. 
7.11.4.  Additional Requirements for Community Solar Projects 
A community solar project must demonstrate that it has met a minimum subscription level to be 
considered energized and eligible to receive payment for RECs.  Under Section 1-75(c)(1)(K) of the 
IPA Act, 50% of the subscriptions must be from small subscribers, and at least 50% of the capacity of 
the project must be subscribed at the time of energization in order to receive payment for RECs, and 
that payment will be based upon calculating the number of RECs that correspond with the amount of 
the  project’s  capacity  that  has  been  initially  subscribed.  The  Approved  Vendor  shall  report 
subscription levels on a quarterly basis during the first year. The calculation of the number of RECs 
for payment will be updated after one year of operation (based on the final quarterly report of that 
first year) to allow for the acquisition of additional subscribers. A community solar project may 
request one additional extension (with a refundable extension payment as provided for in Section 
7.11.2) to its energized date if it needs additional time to acquire subscribers.  
To  the  extent  that  an  Approved  Vendor  demonstrates  additional  subscriptions  or  updated 
subscription mixes that would entitle the Approved Vendor to a greater payment, the contract will 
require that subsequent payments reflect the increased value for quarters where the additional 
subscriptions or updated subscription mix entitle the Approved Vendor to additional revenue. If 
subscriber levels (or mixes) change in such a manner that contract value is reduced, the additional 
payments would also be adjusted downwards accordingly.419 
The calculation of the maximum number of RECs due payment is determined by the project’s 
subscription level after one year of operation (and will be subject to the maintenance of subscription

211,219,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
levels as described in Section 7.15).  For determining the contract payment amount based on a 
project’s subscription level, Section 1-75(c)(1)(L) of the IPA Act provides that, 
Notwithstanding  the  preceding,  for  those  projects  participating  under  item  (iii)  of 
subparagraph (K), the contract price for a delivery year shall be based on subscription levels 
as measured on the higher of the first business day of the delivery year or the first business 
day 6 months after the first business day of the delivery year. Subscription of 90% of 
nameplate capacity or greater shall be deemed to be fully subscribed for the purposes of this 
item (iv). 
Subscription of 90% of a project’s nameplate capacity or greater being deemed fully subscribed 
applies to each quarterly report in which an Approved Vendor must verify a project’s subscription 
levels.  Thus, a project at 85% subscribed under this approach would have a contract price associated 
with an 85% subscribed project, while a project 92% subscribed would be considered “fully 
subscribed.”  Ongoing requirements for overall subscription levels and small subscriber participation 
are discussed further in Section 7.9.6.1. 
7.12.  REC Delivery 
Once a system is energized, it is required to begin REC delivery. For systems larger than 5 kW, the 
first REC must be delivered within 90 days of when the system is energized and registered in GATS 
or M-RETS. For systems smaller than 5 kW, 180 days will be allowed. The 15 or 20-year delivery term 
will begin in the month following the first REC delivery and will last 180 months or 240 months 
respectively, depending on project category.    
Approved Vendors will be required to set up an irrevocable Standing Order for the transfer of RECs 
from the system to the utility.420 As the Agency understands that automatic transfers can only be 
terminated with the consent of both parties, this will reduce the risk to the utility that the RECs could 
be sold to another party after the utility has paid for them.  
As part of the Annual Report discussed in Section 7.15, the Approved Vendor will report on any 
systems that have not delivered a first REC, and report on any systems that have not delivered RECs 
for more than a year from their previous delivery. The report will also detail what corrective actions 
will be taken to ensure future deliveries. In the event of failure to remedy non-delivery of RECs, the 
utility may draw on the collateral it holds from the Approved Vendor. 
7.12.1.  Ongoing Performance Requirements  
A significant challenge for the Adjustable Block Program is that the payment for RECs is front loaded 
for categories other than Traditional Community Solar and Public Schools (which pay for RECs on 
delivery over 20 years); systems up to 25 kW feature full contract prepayment upon energization, 
and all payments for systems over 25 kW will be made within the first six years of energization. Yet 
those contracts have a 15-year REC delivery obligation. This creates a situation in which, absent any 
additional measures, the buyer (the utility) will be unable to use the typical contractual tool of 
withholding payments for the item not yet received to ensure REC delivery. Fortunately, the Act 
anticipated this issue and requires that “[e]ach contract shall include provisions to ensure the

212,220,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
delivery of the estimated quantity of renewable energy credits and ongoing collateral requirements 
and other provisions deemed appropriate by the Agency.”421 
The Agency will utilize the approach described below to ensure REC delivery over the full term of the 
contracts. This approach will also ensure proper matching of adders for photovoltaic community 
renewable generation projects at different levels of residential subscription levels. 
REC delivery obligations will be managed at a portfolio level. As projects are completed and become 
energized, each Approved Vendor will therefore have a portfolio of systems with REC delivery 
obligations from the various contracts that it has with each utility. The obligation to ensure REC 
delivery is at the contract level rather than the individual project level. In this way, the natural 
variation that some systems will produce more RECs than forecast and others fewer RECs reduces 
the risk of contract default, as compared to project-level contracts, and allows for ease in contract 
administration. 
7.12.2.  Collateral Requirements 
An Approved Vendor is required to post collateral equivalent to 5% of the total contract value within 
30 business days of when each Batch’s contract (or product order) is approved. As described in 
Section 7.10.6, if the collateral was provided in the form of a Letter of Credit, then the Approved 
Vendor may choose for the utility to withhold the collateral amount for each system from the last 
REC payment for the system (or only REC payment for small systems) in exchange for not needing to 
maintain the collateral in the form of the Letter of Credit. In this situation, the collateral would be 
reduced as described below, and fully returned at the end of the contract (net any amounts that were 
drawn to meet contractual obligations). As systems are energized, this collateral amount (or deferred 
payment) will be maintained through the life of the contract. This requirement will be maintained at 
the portfolio level, not the individual contract or system level. The collateral amount is based upon 
the contract value at the time of ICC approval of the product order and is not adjusted if the final 
system size and/or capacity factor (and thus resulting quantity of RECs for payment) is lower than 
the initial approved amount.  
By maintaining collateral requirements at the portfolio level, Approved Vendors can better manage 
the  risk  that  some  systems  may  underperform  (or  have  other  problems)  while  others  may 
overperform. This allows the collateral level to be lower than it would be if maintained at the system 
level.  
The Agency wishes to emphasize that this Plan does not prescribe the source of funds for collateral, 
whether it be an Approved Vendor’s cash on hand, bank borrowings, the project owner’s funds, 
customer-provided funds, a letter of credit, or some other source.   
Nonetheless, an Approved Vendor will be responsible for delivering RECs each year under its 
contracts (subject to the reduction options described in the following Section). On an annual basis, 
failure to deliver RECs for the previous year will result in the utility drawing on the collateral to be 
compensated for the undelivered RECs from that year for which payment was already received. After 
any such drawing, the Approved Vendor will need to restore its collateral level to bring it back up to 
the 5% of remaining value of the portfolio within 90 days. If the amount of collateral held for an 
Approved Vendor is insufficient to compensate the utility, the Approved Vendor will be required to

213,221,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
pay the utility for the balance of the value of the undelivered RECs from that previous year. Failure 
to make payment and/or maintain the collateral requirement may result in the Approved Vendor’s 
suspension from participating in the Program. 
Additionally, the Agency understands and appreciates that the natural degradation of photovoltaic 
system’s productive capacity will likely result in reduced delivery quantities in the later years of a 
system’s performance under a REC delivery contract.  Annual contractual REC delivery volumes will 
thus be decline by 0.5% each year, which the Agency believes should help ensure that collateral is 
not unfairly drawn upon due to reduced system performance.422  
Reconciliation of REC deliveries and collateral requirements will be conducted on an annual basis 
based on the Annual Reports filed by the Approved Vendors as described in Section 7.15. 
7.12.3.  Options to Reduce REC Delivery Obligations 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(L) of the IPA Act provides that, for categories other than Traditional Community 
Solar and Public Schools projects, “[t]he electric utility shall receive and retire all renewable energy 
credits generated by the project for the first 15 years of operation.”423 The capacity factor as 
described in Section 7.10.5 will be used to calculate the number of expected RECs each system 
generates, and thus the overall payment for that system. If a system produces more RECs than 
expected from that calculation, then no adjustment would be made to payments or to the statutorily 
mandated REC delivery term. However, if the system produces fewer than the contracted quantity of 
RECs, then the following conditions apply. 
The Agency expects each Approved Vendor to take the steps necessary to ensure that projects 
contained within its portfolio meet all expected REC deliveries. This may include working with 
system owners to ensure that ongoing maintenance and repairs of systems occurs as well as to ensure 
that meter/inverter data is properly transferred to GATS or M-RETS for the creation of RECs. 
Furthermore, Approved Vendors will be responsible for ensuring the ongoing transfer of RECs to the 
applicable utility. However, because weather and other factors may impact annual production values, 
REC delivery performance will be evaluated on a three-year rolling-average basis, although any 
overproduction may be carried forward (or “banked”) for performance evaluation and collateral 
purposes into future contract years without expiration.424  However, a project or portfolio is not 
entitled to additional compensation if a carryforward remains as project-specific contracts expire.425   
There are circumstances where a system may not be able to deliver the RECs it was expected to 
produce; the Agency believes that reasonable accommodations should be made for these situations 
that appropriately balance the requirements for the utilities to comply with RPS targets and their 
expectation to receive RECs for which payment has already been made while acknowledging that 
unexpected situations may arise at no fault of the Approved Vendor.    
In force majeure circumstances (including, but not limited to, physical damage to the system from 
fires, tornados, etc.) the Approved Vendor may request to have a delivery obligation suspended,

reduced, or eliminated without penalty.426 Approval of the recognition of a force majeure event 
requires consensus between the Agency and the contracting utility.  Curtailments by either the utility 
(including those through a smart inverter) or the RTO that result in reduced REC production would 
allow for reduced REC delivery obligations. 
In  the  case  of  reductions  or  eliminations  of  delivery  obligations,  the  Approved  Vendor  must 
demonstrate what measures have been taken that do not adequately cure the situation (such as filing 
and receiving an insurance claim that is inadequate to restore the system to operation). For the 
suspension  of  delivery  obligations,  the  Approved  Vendor  must  demonstrate  that  reasonable 
measures are being taken to have a timely restoration of production. Approved suspension of 
delivery obligations will serve to change the end date for the REC delivery timeline to reflect the time 
the delivery obligations were suspended. 
An Approved Vendor may also determine that a system is not performing at the level expected in the 
absence of force majeure circumstances. In this circumstance, the Approved Vendor may request to 
have the delivery obligation related to that system within its portfolio reduced in exchange for the 
return to the utility of a payment adjustment to account for all undelivered RECs at the original 
delivery level as of the time of the request.  
These provisions will not apply to Traditional Community Solar projects and Public Schools projects 
as the delivery and payment obligations for those projects under 20-year contracts is based on actual 
delivery of RECs. Section 1-75(c)(1)(L)(iv) provides for adjustments to payments based on those 
deliveries including the ability to carry forward higher than expected REC deliveries, 
If generation of renewable energy credits during a delivery year exceeds the estimated 
annual  generation  amount,  the  excess  renewable  energy  credits  shall  be  carried 
forward to future delivery years and shall not expire during the delivery term. If 
generation  of renewable  energy  credits  during  a  delivery  year,  including  carried 
forward excess renewable energy credits, if any, is less than the estimated annual 
generation amount, payments during such delivery year will not exceed the quantity 
generated plus the quantity carried forward multiplied by the contract price. The 
electric utility shall receive all renewable energy credits generated by the project during 
the first 20 years of operation and retire all renewable energy credits paid for under this 
item (iv) and return at the end of the delivery term all renewable energy credits that 
were not paid for. 
7.13.  Payment Terms 
The Act provides a schedule of payments for RECs for projects. Section 1-75(c)(1)(L) of the IPA Act 
as updated by Public Act 102-0662 specifies the following schedule for projects in categories other 
than Traditional Community Solar and Public Schools projects: For systems up to 25 kW, “the 
renewable energy credit delivery contract value shall be paid in full, based on the estimated 
generation during the first 15 years of operation by the contracting utilities at the time that the 
facility producing the renewable energy credits is interconnected at the distribution system level of 
the utility and verified as energized and compliant by the Program Administrator.” 
 
426 Specific circumstances that constitute force majeure have been outlined and memorialized in the REC Contract. 
214 
 ",7. Adjustable Block Program ,[],682,18,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
215,223,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
For distributed generation systems greater than 25 kW and up to 5,000 kW and community solar 
projects, “15% of the renewable energy credit delivery contract value, based on the estimated 
generation during the first 15 years of operation, shall be paid by the contracting utilities at the time 
that the facility producing the renewable energy credits is interconnected at the distribution system 
level of the utility and verified as energized and compliant by the Program Administrator. The 
remaining portion shall be paid ratably over the subsequent 6-year period.” 
For Traditional Community Solar projects and Public Schools projects, the payment terms are not on 
a set schedule, rather are for,  
20 years and shall be paid over the delivery term, not to exceed during each delivery 
year the contract price multiplied by the estimated annual renewable energy credit 
generation amount. If generation of renewable energy credits during a delivery year 
exceeds the estimated annual generation amount, the excess renewable energy credits 
shall be carried forward to future delivery years and shall not expire during the delivery 
term. If generation of renewable energy credits during a delivery year, including carried 
forward excess renewable energy credits, if any, is less than the estimated annual 
generation amount, payments during such delivery year will not exceed the quantity 
generated plus the quantity carried forward multiplied by the contract price. 
The Agency has established that the standard for being “energized” as used above must include the 
completion of the interconnection approval by the local utility and the registration of the system in 
GATS or M-RETS so that generation data can be tracked, and RECs created.427  In addition, to avoid a 
system being completed but RECs not created and delivered, before a system can be considered 
“energized” so as to initiate the processing of an invoice for REC delivery contract payments, 
automatic assignment of RECs to the applicable utility must be initiated. The Agency believes that by 
ensuring proper registration in the tracking system up front, future administrative challenges can be 
minimized.  
For systems over 25 kW and community solar projects other than Traditional Community Solar, it is 
not clear from the law how exactly the “subsequent 6-year period” would be calculated, and whether 
the frequency of payments should be annually, quarterly, or monthly. The Agency proposed in the 
Initial Plan (which featured a 20% upfront payment and subsequent payments over a 4-year period 
based upon now changed provisions from Public Act 99-0906) that after the first payment of 20%, 
the balance of payments be made on a quarterly basis over the following 16 quarters. For example, if 
the first payment is made on September 30, 2019 (upon interconnection and energization), assuming 
continued compliance with contractual requirements, the next payments would occur approximately 
on December 31, 2019, March 31, 2020, etc., with the final payment on approximately September 30, 
2023—resulting in 17 total payments that bookend a four-year period of time.  Payment amounts 
occur on a set schedule and may be adjusted to reflect changes in REC quantities (per Section 7.12.3), 
or community solar subscription levels (per Section 7.11.4).  Based on feedback received to date, the 
Agency does not believe that a change to the basic quarterly payment schedule is warranted 
(although the quarters of subsequent payments will increase to 24). However, the refreshed contract 
 
427 This proposed standard is only intended to relate to the contractual payment terms for the Program. Section 1-75(c)(1)(K) specifies 
that, “[o]nly projects energized on or after June 1, 2017 shall be eligible for the Adjustable Block program.” The Agency views this to mean 
that a project must be interconnected to the applicable utility after June 1, 2017 and that the registration date of the system in GATS or M-
RETS does not impact that determination. The added contractual standard is meant to ensure that energized systems will produce the 
RECs that they are receiving upfront payments for.

structure described in Section 7.14 that has been implemented now allows for three separate 
quarterly delivery schedules to reduce the lag time between a project being approved for payment 
and the first (or only) payment being received.428   
Section 1-75(c)(1)(L)(vii) also requires that: 
If, at any time, approved applications for the Adjustable Block program exceed funds 
collected by the electric utility or would cause the Agency to exceed the limitation 
described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (1) on the amount of renewable energy 
resources that may be procured, then the Agency may consider future uncommitted 
funds to be reserved for these contracts on a first-come, first-served basis.  
The Agency will continue to carefully monitor project application approvals and available budgets.  
Nevertheless, aside from waitlisted projects replacing defunct projects as already accounted for in 
budget modeling, the Agency will not recommend Commission approval of contracts for additional 
projects if it determines that contract obligations cannot be met through expected funds. The Agency 
will endeavor to publish updates to available budgets and related information on regular intervals, 
as discussed in Chapter 3 of this Plan. 
7.14.  Contracts 
The Agency notes that while payments are made according to the terms described in Section 7.13, 
the  Adjustable  Block  Program  and  its  REC  delivery  contracts  feature  ongoing  performance 
requirements to ensure that RECs are delivered across the 15 or 20-year term of the contracts, 
especially after payments have been made under 15-year contracts. Section 7.12.1 describes in more 
detail how those performance requirements have been implemented. 
The Agency, in consultation with its Program Administrator and its Procurement Administrator, 
developed a standard REC delivery contract between the utilities and Approved Vendors, much as its 
Procurement Administrator had done for the competitive procurement processes. This included the 
opportunity for interested parties to comment on the contract. The original REC delivery contract, 
reflecting the consensus of the Agency, the utilities, and Commission Staff, was finalized in January 
2019, just prior to the opening of the Adjustable Block Program for project applications. Once 
finalized, that standard 2019 REC delivery contract was not subject to further negotiation for each 
project or batch accepted into the Program. 
For the First Revised Plan, the Agency proposed a substantial refresh of the standard delivery 
contract based upon lessons learned from the execution and early administration of the initial 
contracts. The Agency conducted stakeholder workshops in 2020 to review the contract structure 
for the Adjustable Block Program, the Illinois Solar for All Program, and competitive procurements.429 
Key issues that were considered included: 
 
428 For example, a project approved for payment in January would be on a quarterly schedule of payments occurring in February, May, 
August, and November; a project approved for payment in February would be on a quarterly schedule of payments occurring in March, 
June, September, and December; and a project approved for payment in March would be on a quarterly schedule of payments occurring in 
April, July, October, and January. 
429 This process began on April 9, 2020 with the release of a request for stakeholder feedback. See:

•  Shortening and simplifying the REC Contract (and, if possible, synthesizing the contract into 
a single set of terms and conditions)  
•  Clarifying contract default versus system default versus penalties 
•  Clarifying Product Orders, Master Contracts, and Portfolio-level responsibilities 
•  Termination for convenience (subject to applicable penalties)   
•  Measurement of community solar subscription levels 
•  Mechanism of collateral holdbacks430 
•  Incorporation of Acknowledgement of Assignment forms 
•  Removal of a project from the contract 
•  Adoption of a measure providing for mediation by the IPA between utilities and Approved 
Vendors in certain REC Contract disputes431 
Based  on  the  workshops,  the  Agency  worked  with  the  Program  Administrator,  Procurement 
Administrator, ICC Staff, and the utilities to develop a draft of a refreshed standard contract and 
provided stakeholders the opportunity to comment on the refreshed contract. Based on comments 
received from participants in the process, implementation of the refreshed REC contract was 
deferred until new blocks were able to open—which occurred in December 2021 after the enactment 
of Public Act 102-0662. For program reopening in December 2021, two versions of the contract were 
released, one for projects under a 15-year REC delivery commitment, and one for projects under a 
20-year  REC  delivery  commitment.  These  two  contract  structures  also  incorporated  changes 
necessary to comply with provisions of Public Act 102-0662.432  
The Agency expects that, as a result of the approval of this 2022 Long-Term Plan, the REC delivery 
contracts may require additional updates.  As of the filing of this Final Plan, a stakeholder feedback 
process  is  underway  to  develop  the  revised contracts  with  input  from  the  utilities,  program 
participants, ICC Staff, and other stakeholders.433  Revised contracts will be published by August 31, 
2022.   
Once any updated contracts are finalized and thus required to be used, Approved Vendors may 
withdraw projects that had been submitted to the Program before the updated contract’s finalization 
(that are not yet ICC-approved) with no penalty. 
As the contract structure will be altered as a result of the above-mentioned process, the Agency 
recommends that projects approved by the Commission after the contract finalization date would 
use the new contract, regardless of application date.  The Program will also provide an “off-ramp” 
option for any already-applied projects expecting to be subject to the original 2019 REC Delivery 
Contract rendered unable to be developed under the updated 2021 REC Delivery Contracts (although 
this appears to be unlikely given the nature of modifications found in the updated contract).

7.15.  Annual Report 
On an annual basis, each Approved Vendor is required submit an Annual Report of the contracts and 
systems in its portfolio.434 The Annual Report serves as the basis for verifying that RECs from projects 
are being delivered to the applicable utility, and, absent corrective actions taken by the Approved 
Vendor, will be used to determine what actions should be taken by the utilities to enforce the 
contractual requirements that RECs are delivered, including, but not limited to, drawing on collateral. 
Additionally, the Annual Report will be used by the Agency to consider the ongoing eligibility of an 
Approved Vendor to continue participation in the program. 
For distributed generation systems, the report will include information on: 
•  RECs delivered by each of the systems in the portfolio 
•  Status of all systems that have been approved, but not yet energized, including any extensions 
requested and granted  
•  Energized systems that have not delivered RECs in the year 
•  Balance of collateral held by each utility  
•  A summary of requests for REC obligations reductions due to force majeure events 
•  A summary of requests for REC obligations, suspensions, reductions, or eliminations due to 
force majeure events 
•  Information on consumer complaints received 
•  Other information related to ongoing program participation, including use of graduates of job 
training programs and other information related to increasing the diversity of the solar 
workforce435 
For community solar projects, the report will include those requirements listed above for distributed 
generation projects and additionally: 
•  Percentage of each system subscribed on a capacity basis 
•  The  number  and  type  of  subscribers  (e.g.,  residential,  small  commercial,  large 
commercial/industrial), including capacity allocated to each type 
•  Subscriber turn-over rates436 
The Agency will review the annual reports to assess compliance with the requirements of the 
Adjustable Block Program and, if there are shortfalls of REC deliveries or subscription levels for 
photovoltaic community renewable generation projects, will coordinate with the applicable utility 
on what remedies should be taken, including drawing on collateral.437  For this process and those 
 
434 Approved Vendors may request confidential treatment of the Annual Report. However, aggregated information from Annual Reports 
may be publicly disclosed by the Agency to the extent that it does not disclose Approved Vendor-specific confidential information. 
435 As discussed in the Commission’s Order approving the First Revised Plan, this requirement was added in order to learn from and 
celebrate how the increase in solar development in Illinois is improving diversity in the state’s renewable energy workforce.  The IPA 
commits to gathering this information for informational purposes only.  See Docket No. 19-0995, Final Order dated February 18, 2020 at 
87. 
436 The Commission specifically approved the inclusion of subscriber turnover rates in annual reports, noting that it will allow the IPA the 
ability to make more informed decisions regarding community solar program requirements.  See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated 
July 14, 2022 at 105-106.  
437 The Agency will request on a semi-annual basis a report from each utility on RECs delivered by contract. 
218 
 ",7. Adjustable Block Program ,[],652,13,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf

described in the next two paragraphs, the performance evaluation and collateral draw methodologies 
have been specified in the standard REC delivery contract. 
For community solar projects, subscription levels must be maintained to remain eligible for REC 
payments. If the annual report shows that subscriber levels on a rolling average basis have fallen 
below the subscribership level that the project contractually committed to, then if REC payments are 
still due, those payments will be reduced as described earlier in this chapter; if all payments have 
been made, then the Agency will work with the applicable utility on what remedies should be taken 
including drawing on collateral.  If a project’s subscribership falls below 50% for a given delivery 
year, no payment would be owed to the project for that delivery year, and a payment reduction or 
collateral draw would result (although the project could regain 50% subscribership the following 
year and qualify for payment in relation to that year). 
A similar review will be conducted for projects that have received a small subscriber participation 
adder but do not maintain sufficient levels of small subscriber participation. If small subscriber 
participation levels are not maintained and there are remaining REC payments due, those payments 
will be reduced (to either the actual small subscriber adder category that has been maintained, or to 
remove the adder altogether if the level falls below 25%). If all payments have been made, then the 
Agency will work with the applicable utility on what remedies should be taken including drawing on 
collateral.  
Approved Vendors will be given 90 days to cure any deficiencies found by the Agency and/or utilities, 
and the failure to submit annual reports or cure deficiencies may carry consequences under REC 
delivery contracts and/or result in disciplinary action under the Program. 
In addition to the Adjustable Block Program Annual Report, Approved Vendors and Designees will 
also be required to file an annual report related to their Equity Accountability Compliance Plan as 
described in Section 10.1.1.3. As the Equity Accountability System does not launch until June 1, 2023, 
the first report on the Equity Accountability Compliance Plan will not be due until July 15, 2024.

8. Illinois Solar for All 
8.1. Overview 
The Illinois Solar for All Program (“ILSFA”) was created in 2017 through revisions to Section 1-56(b) 
of the IPA Act contained in Public Act 99-0906 to “include incentives for low-income distributed 
generation and community solar projects” with the following objectives:  
bring photovoltaics to low-income communities in this State in a manner that maximizes 
the development of new photovoltaic generating facilities, to create a long-term, low-
income solar marketplace throughout this State, to integrate, through interaction with 
stakeholders, with existing energy efficiency initiatives, and to minimize administrative 
costs.438 
Public Act 99-0906 created four sub-programs within Illinois Solar for All, with incentives for each 
type of development: 
(A) Low-income Distributed Generation, for on-site solar projects 
(B) Low-Income Community Solar, for off-site solar projects 
(C) Incentives for non-profits and public facilities to do on-site projects 
(D) Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Projects, with distinct rules and incentives 
  
The Act instructed the Agency to “include a description of its proposed approach to the design, 
administration, implementation and evaluation of the Illinois Solar for All Program” in this Plan. The 
Agency’s Initial Long-Term Plan fulfilled this requirement for the Illinois Solar for All Program, and 
the Agency selected a Program Administrator and launched to program in early 2019. 
While the price of photovoltaics has declined dramatically over recent years, there can be significant 
upfront costs for the development of projects. The financial incentives offered through the Adjustable 
Block Program may not be sufficient for low-income households and communities to overcome the 
substantial barriers to participating in the growing solar energy market.  The Illinois Solar for All 
Program is an alternative approach and program to help address this challenge.  
Public Act 102-0662, which took effect on September 15, 2021, updated the sub-programs that 
comprise Illinois Solar for All, increased available funding, and prioritized expanding participation in 
Illinois  Solar  for  All  to  areas  of  Illinois  previously  underserved  by  the  program,  increasing 
development  by  small  and  emerging  businesses,  and  encouraging  development  of  projects 
promoting energy sovereignty.   
The updates to the sub-program structure of Illinois Solar for All by Public Act 102-0662 eliminated 
the Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Projects and split the Low-Income Distributed Generation 
sub-program  into  separate  sub-programs  for  distributed  generation  projects  serving  small 
residential (single- to four-unit residences) and large residential (five units or more) buildings.  The 
Illinois Solar for All sub-programs under Public Act 102-0662 now consist of: 
(A) Low-income Single-Family and Small Multifamily Solar 
(B) Low-Income Community Solar 
(C) Incentives for non-profits and public facilities 
 
438 20 ILCS 3855/1-56(b)(2).

221,229,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
(D) Low-income large multifamily solar 
 
The funding allocation percentages for these sub-programs were also adjusted, distributing the 
funding  no  longer  allocated  for  the  Low-Income  Community  Solar  Pilot  Projects  to  the  new 
subprograms, with the Low-income Single-Family and Small Multifamily Solar and the Low-income 
multifamily solar sub-programs sharing a funding allocation. 
8.2. Existing and New Design Elements 
In initially developing the program, the Agency identified two key design elements for implementing 
the Illinois Solar for All Program that needed more focused discussion: the relationship to the 
Adjustable Block Program, and the creation of “tangible economic benefits” for participants. With the 
new provisions contained in Public Act 102-0662 the Agency has expanded its consideration of key 
design elements to also include small and emerging business development and energy sovereignty. 
8.2.1.  Relationship with the Adjustable Block Program 
The goals of the Illinois Solar for All Program overlap with the goals of the Adjustable Block Program 
in that both promote distributed photovoltaic generation and community solar. The differences 
primarily involve the sectors that the programs serve, the structure of the incentives and program 
design, and the applicable funding sources.  
As described in this Chapter, the Agency administers the Illinois Solar for All Program separately 
from the Adjustable Block Program, but it is built off of the program design of the Adjustable Block 
Program, with additional considerations specific to Illinois Solar for All. These include a different 
level of incentives, additional requirements to be an Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor, additional 
project  application  requirements,  Illinois  Solar  for  All  specific  contracts,  and  additional 
considerations to ensure community involvement, consumer protections, and eligibility. To the 
extent not specifically mentioned in this Chapter, the program design, terms, and conditions of the 
Adjustable Block Program also apply to the administration of, and REC delivery contracts executed 
under, the Illinois Solar for All Program.  
Many of the fundamental aspects of the Illinois Solar for All Program are identical, or at least similarly 
structured to the Adjustable Block Program, as detailed in Chapter 7 of this Plan.  For example, as in 
ABP, projects located on a single parcel are considered co-located, which influences determination of 
system size and eligible REC prices (Section 7.5.5).  To ensure program funds go to entities that have 
been properly vetted and commit to compliance with program terms, Illinois Solar for All accepts 
applications from program Approved Vendors, just as in ABP (Section 7.7).  In order to qualify to 
apply to be an Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor, the developer must register and maintain their 
status as an Approved Vendor with the Adjustable Block Program (Section 7.7.2).  Entities that are 
not interested in entering into REC contracts as Approved Vendors but are subcontracted to work on 
ILSFA projects must register as Approved Vendor Designees (Sections 7.8 and 7.8.1).  Additional 
requirements to qualify as an Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor are found below in Section 8.9. 
As with the Adjustable Block Program, Illinois Solar for All projects must meet technical and metering 
system requirements (Section 7.9.1 ad 7.9.2) as well as the same basic  consumer protection 
requirements found in Chapter 9, with additional consumer protection requirements for Illinois Solar 
for All participation detailed below in Section 8.11. 
221 
 ",8. Illinois Solar for All ,[],702,21,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
222,230,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
The requirements for a project to participate as a community solar project follow the framework 
outlined in Sections 7.9.6, 7.9.6.1, 7.9.6.2, and 7.9.6.3, while providing the additional participant 
savings and consumer protections detailed in this chapter. 
As in Section 7.10, there is an application process for the submission of projects to the Illinois Solar 
for All program:  
•  Projects are submitted in batches (7.10.1),  
•  Are reviewed by the Program Administrator (7.10.4),  
•  Have the anticipated quantity of RECs generated by the system over the contract term 
calculated (7.10.5), and,  
•  If in compliance with program requirements and selected, are submitted to the ICC for final 
approval (7.10.6).   
Following ICC approval, REC contracts are:  
•  Executed by the Approved Vendor and the contract Buyer for the RECs produced by the 
project (7.12).   
•  Project construction is completed (if it wasn’t already) and must submit confirmation of 
utility energization and document final project details within a given deadline (7.11.1).   
•  If an Approved Vendor is unable to meet a project’s given deadline, the REC contract provides 
options  for  requesting  extensions  to  the  deadline  for  meeting  contract  energization 
requirements (7.11.2)    
•  Once  an  Approved  Vendor  has  provided  the  Program  Administrator  the  required 
documentation to confirm project completion and energization by the utility, the project can 
be approved for payment (7.11.3).   
•  RECs generated by the project are delivered to the contract Buyer through irrevocable 
Standing Order and reported to the Program Administrator regularly through an Annual 
Reporting process (7.15).   
•  A collateral payment is required from the Approved Vendor Performance to ensure REC 
deliveries requirements are met for the duration of the REC contract (Section 7.12, 7.12.1, 
and 7.12.2).   
•  Following approval for payment, the Approved Vendor invoices the Buyer for payment on a 
schedule determined by the project type as outlined below. 
Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors must maintain status of good standing in the Adjustable Block 
Program as well as the Illinois Solar for All program, which includes submission of Annual Reports of 
REC deliveries and other program metrics for each program (7.15).  The details and any differences 
in how these concepts are implemented within the Illinois Solar for All program are detailed further 
in the Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor Manual. 
8.2.2.  Tangible Economic Benefits 
The second consideration is the concept of “tangible economic benefits” and how low-income 
participants can capture them.  Section 1-56(b)(2) of the Act stipulates that the Illinois Solar for All 
Program should “ensure tangible economic benefits flow directly to program participants.""  
The requirement that low-income program participants receive tangible benefits carries into the 
parameters of the contracts executed within the Illinois Solar for All Program as well.  Section 1-
222 
 ",8. Illinois Solar for All ,['8.2.2.'],612,16,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
223,231,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
56(b)(2) also requires that “[e]ach contract that provides for the installation of solar facilities shall 
provide that the solar facilities will produce energy and economic benefits, at a level determined by 
the Agency to be reasonable, for the participating low-income customers.”439  In addition, contracts 
should “ensure [that] the wholesale market value of the energy is credited to participating low-
income customers or organizations and to ensure tangible economic benefits flow directly to 
program participants, except in the case of low-income multi-family housing when the low-income 
customer does not directly pay for energy.”440 For the purposes of this chapter the term “multi-
family” applies to residential buildings with five or more units. 
A key barrier to low-income participation in renewable energy programs is lack of access to funds 
and financing to pay for the up-front costs of photovoltaic systems.  
To create “tangible economic benefits” at a “reasonable” level, the Agency has determined that 
eligible residential participants in the Illinois Solar for All Program should not have to pay up-front 
costs for on-site distributed generation or pay an up-front fee to subscribe to a community solar 
project.441 Further, participation in the program should result in immediate, reliable reductions in 
energy costs for those residents or subscribers. Consistent with the Commission’s Order in Docket 
No. 17-0838, this means that for projects that are financed or leased, any ongoing annual payments 
must be smaller than 50% of the annual first year estimated production and/or utility default service 
net metering value to be received by the customer.442  
The Agency will implement two exceptions to this no up-front costs standard. The first exception is 
for Low-income large multi-family solar initiative projects (multi-family projects of five or more 
units) where the participant purchases the system.  In this case, the residential participant’s first-
year savings may be less than 50% so long as the calculation of that customer’s expected ongoing 
savings demonstrates that this requirement would be met through overall savings applied across the 
full 15 years of the REC delivery contract. The second would be to allow low-income community solar 
projects that are organized as cooperatives to promote energy sovereignty to charge a nominal fee 
to join the cooperative. The Agency will establish a methodology for setting a cap on up-front fees for 
low-income members of such cooperatives after conducting a stakeholder feedback process to solicit 
public input on potential methodologies.443  
The Agency requires that Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors verify that developers, installers, 
landlords, and other intermediaries ensure that the resulting value of the incentives offered by the 
program flow through to the people the program is meant to serve. However, the Agency notes that 
in order to avoid an overly complex administrative system, incentive levels are not customized to 
each participant’s specific economic circumstances.  
 
439 20 ILCS 3855/1-56(b)(2). 
440 Id. 
441 This requirement does not apply to multi-family buildings with more than five units, or projects in the non-profit/ public facilities sub-
program. 
442 See Docket No. 17-0838, Final Order dated April 3, 2018 at 151.  As required by the Commission’s Order, this calculation must be 
“disclosed to the customer and reviewed and approved by the Agency.” 
443 This change reflects a request for clarification in the Long-Term Plan litigation regarding whether the Agency will set a single fee cap or 
whether the cap will change based on the project. The Commission’s Order approved the Agency’s proposed solution of clarifying that the 
IPA will set a methodology, not a single number, for the fee cap and that it will seek stakeholder feedback on that methodology. See Docket 
No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 110.

224,232,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
For public and non-profit facilities that participate in the Illinois Solar for All Program, the Agency 
will continue to utilize an incentive level that recognizes that these entities may not be able to capture 
the tax benefits that would be available to a comparable sized project participating in the Adjustable 
Block Program.444 The higher REC price offered by the Illinois Solar for All Program can help 
overcome the financing barriers that certain non-profits and public facilities may face compared to 
private entities. The Agency observes that over 180 non-profit and public facility projects (exceeding 
60 MW of capacity) applied to the Adjustable Block Program in its initial blocks, indicating that many 
such projects are viable at the REC prices offered by that program.  
In order to account for these additional tax benefits, in the First Revised Plan the Agency proposed 
that Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors submitting projects for non-profit or public facilities that 
can utilize the federal Investment Tax Credit under 26 U.S.C. § 48 will be required to demonstrate 
additional value to the project host.  The Agency maintains that approach for this 2022 Plan, as 
discussed further in Section 8.5.6 below.  
Existing net metering provisions ensure that “the wholesale market value of energy is credited to 
participating  low-income  customers.”  Therefore,  projects  are  required  to  participate  in  the 
applicable utility’s or ARES’s net metering program. This may prevent projects in the service territory 
of a municipal utility or rural electric cooperative that does not offer net metering from participating 
in the Illinois Solar for All Program. The Agency hopes that such municipal utilities and rural electric 
cooperatives strongly consider adopting net metering policies to bring the full value of solar to their 
residents and members.  
Approved Vendors may demonstrate that they are ensuring that tangible economic benefits flow 
directly to program participants by providing documentary evidence to the Agency that: a project on 
a one to four-unit residential building has no upfront cost to the residential participant, except in 
cases of system purchases; that incentives are used by the project developer/installer to offset costs 
to the participant; and that there will not be ongoing costs or fees to the participant that exceed 50% 
of the value of energy produced. The resulting economic benefits to program participants will be 
accrued through the value they receive through net metering or avoided consumption from the 
energy the system produces. As described in Section 8.2.2, Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors are 
required to document how they ensure that this goal is met. The case of low-income multi-family 
housing can be more complex and is discussed in more detail in Section 8.5.4.3. 
It should be noted that program incentives are tied directly to creating economic benefits through 
lowered net energy costs and are calculated in that manner. As a result, there may be additional costs 
required to make a specific project viable (e.g., costs associated with roof repairs or wiring upgrades) 
that these incentives may not be able to address. Additional incentives to pay for those types of costs 
are generally not available through the Illinois Solar for All Program, but the Agency encourages 
participants to explore alternative sources of funding as needed. For example, Public Act 102-0662 
creates a number of new initiatives administered by other state agencies such as the Department of 
Commerce and Economic Opportunity and the Illinois Finance Authority as described further in 
Section 8.8. The Agency and the Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator will also work with 
Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors to facilitate informing and educating program participants 
about opportunities that may be available to them through utility-administered energy efficiency 
programs, weatherization assistance programs, lead abatement programs, building repair and

upgrade programs, and other forms of support. This includes the provision of a Program Resource 
Guide on those programs.445 As described in Section 8.5.3.3, the Agency will implement a pilot to test 
how incentives within Illinois Solar for All could be adjusted in certain circumstances to account for 
the cost of repairs. This pilot will compare the effectiveness of this approach to harnessing separate 
funding opportunities. 
Additionally, in order to facilitate the direct flow of tangible economic benefits to low-income 
residential participants, the Agency and its Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator engaged the 
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) for guidance that would 
clarify the treatment of Illinois Solar for All benefits with regard to cost allowance-based low-income 
housing programs.  Subsequent to the filing of this Plan with the Commission for approval, HUD 
provided  guidance  for  consideration  of  community  solar  credits  that  ensures  HUD  program 
participants residing in individually metered properties in Illinois will not see a rent increase or 
utility allowance adjustment.  This guidance was announced on the Illinois Solar for All website.446  
The Agency expects that HUD will issue additional guidance on solar credits from on-site distributed 
generation. 
8.2.3.  Small and Emerging Business Development 
Public Act 102-0662 included a number of provisions aimed at encouraging business development. 
Section 1-56 (b)(2) now requires the Agency to ""make every effort to ensure that small and emerging 
businesses, particularly those located in low-income and environmental justice communities, are 
able to participate in the Illinois Solar for All Program"" and to report on progress annually.  
While the Act does not define “small and emerging” business, other state and federal programs have 
provided definitions for “small business.” The Illinois Business Enterprise for Minorities, Women, 
and Persons with Disabilities Act promotes “open access in the awarding of State contracts to 
disadvantaged small business enterprises victimized by discriminatory practices.”447 Eligible small 
businesses have annual gross sales of less than $75,000,000.448  The Small Business Set-Aside 
Program of the Illinois Department of Central Management Services reserves certain types of state 
procurement contracts for small businesses.  According to the Department:449  
•  “A small business means one that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in 
its field or operation, and meets the required size status and the following sales limitations: 
…. 
•  No CONSTRUCTION business can exceed $14 Million in annual sales and receipts. 
•  No MANUFACTURING business can employ more than 250 persons."" 
The federal definition of a small business varies by industry. For example, the US Small Business 
Administration (SBA) considers Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors

(NAICS code 238210) that have annual revenues of less than $16.5 million450 as small for federal 
contracting purposes. To help small and emerging businesses participate in the Illinois Solar for All 
Program, the Agency will use the federal SBA definition of “small,” based on annual revenues within 
the appropriate NAICS category.   
Definitions of an “emerging” business vary widely by jurisdiction and may include factors such as the 
novelty of the business or the industry, the duration of operations, revenues or number of employees, 
or whether the majority owner is in a category of people that has suffered discrimination in the past.  
The Agency defines “emerging business” as a business that has been authorized to do business in any 
US state for less than three years.   
Public Act 102-0662 also creates a number of job training and business development programs, as 
discussed in more detail in Section 8.8.1.  While many of these programs focus on technical skills, the 
Agency sees a need for business training, especially around efforts to encourage Small and Emerging 
Businesses, energy sovereignty, and community-driven solar projects. Ownership and management 
of projects requires skills in finance, permitting, regulations, community engagement, marketing, 
customer acquisition and management, and other topics.  Two of the DCEO programs, the Clean 
Energy Contractor Incubator Program and Clean Energy Primes Contractor Accelerator Program, do 
include business development activities. The Agency encourages DCEO and stakeholders to consider 
the need for business training around ownership and management of solar projects. Such a program 
could be supported by or integrated with the Community Solar Energy Sovereignty Grant Program. 
8.2.4.  Energy Sovereignty 
Public Act 102-0662 introduces a new concept for the Illinois Solar for All program, that of energy 
sovereignty. 
Section 1-56(b)(2)(A)(i) requires the Agency to reserve “a portion” of Illinois Solar for All funding 
“for  projects  that  promote  energy  sovereignty  through  ownership  of  projects  by  low-income 
households, not-for-profit organizations providing services to low-income households, affordable 
housing  owners,  community  cooperatives,  or  community-based  limited  liability  companies 
providing services to low-income households.”  
The Act identifies several potential factors that create energy sovereignty, such as “that local people 
have control of the project and reap benefits from the project over and above energy bill savings.” 
Eligible energy sovereignty projects can “promote ownership over time” or “involve partial project 
ownership by communities.” The Act also permits the Agency to set higher incentive levels for 
projects within ILSFA that promote energy sovereignty than for those that do not.  
While the law does not define “energy sovereignty,” Section 1-56(b)(2)(A)(i) refers to two concepts 
in  relation  to  energy  sovereignty.  First,  it  envisions  “ownership  of  projects  by  low-income 
households, not-for-profit organizations providing services to low-income households, affordable 
housing  owners,  community  cooperatives,  or  community-based  limited  liability  companies 
providing services to low-income households; second, it seeks to ensure that “local people have 
control of the project and reap benefits from the project over and above energy bill savings.”

227,235,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Section 1-56(b)(2) does not define “ownership,” but Section 1-75(c)(1)(K)(v) defines ""community 
ownership"" as “an arrangement in which an electric generating facility is, or over time will be, in 
significant part, owned collectively by members of the community to which an electric generating 
facility  provides  benefits;  members  of  that  community  participate  in  decisions  regarding  the 
governance, operation, maintenance, and upgrades of and to that facility; and members of that 
community benefit from regular use of that facility.” While not directly applicable to programs in 
Section 1-56(b), this definition can provide guidance for the Agency in setting a standard for 
“ownership” within the Illinois Solar for All Program. This definition points to the ability of “owners” 
to participate in decisions regarding the operations and management of the facility and to benefit 
from using the facility. For Low-income Single and Small Multifamily Distributed Generation, being 
the sole or majority owner of the solar installation would create such abilities. For Low-Income Large 
Multifamily Distributed Generation and Low-Income Community Solar, see below for factors that the 
Agency will consider as supporting energy sovereignty.  
The second concept included in Section 1-56(b)(2)(A)(i) as an element of energy sovereignty in fact 
contains two factors. First, “that local people have control of the project,” and second, that they “reap 
benefits from the project over and above energy bill savings.  The simplest interpretation of “control” 
is the  ability to determine the use and management of the facility, including operations and 
maintenance, finance and revenues, and other managerial matters. Broader interpretations of 
“control” include a greater sense of “energy democracy"" such as “interdependence, conservation, 
wealth-building, political autonomy, and economic opportunity.""451 Likewise, benefits “over and 
above energy bill savings” flow largely from ownership, such as self-reliance, income and wealth 
building. Local communities may also experience other benefits, such as pollution reduction and 
property tax base, with or without local ownership. (See Appendix G for a full discussion of energy 
sovereignty.) 
The Agency believes that majority or full ownership by individuals or community institutions listed 
by Section 1-56(b)(2)(A)(i) is the most direct way to ensure that local people will have control over 
and reap the benefits from photovoltaic energy projects. The Agency originally proposed to define 
“energy sovereignty” as the eligible low-income household or community organization having or 
being on a defined path to majority or full ownership of the photovoltaic facility.  After consideration 
of stakeholder comments and per the Commission’s Order approving this Plan, the Agency adopts 
the following definition of “energy sovereignty” for the Illinois Solar for All program:452 
“Energy  sovereignty”  means  the  eligible  low-income  household  or  community 
organization having or being on a defined path to majority or full ownership of the 
photovoltaic  generating  facility  or,  in  the  case  of  a  cooperative  or  community 
ownership model, a share or membership in the entity that owns the photovoltaic 
generating facility. For the purpose of this definition, “ownership” means not only 
legal title to the property but also the right to participate in decisions regarding the 
governance, maintenance, and use of the facility and to benefit from the use of that 
facility. For the purpose of this definition, “photovoltaic generating facility” means 
any equipment that generates electricity from solar energy. If the project includes 
associated  energy  storage  equipment,  the  eligible  low-income  household  or

community organization is not required to, but may, own such storage equipment to 
qualify as an “energy sovereignty” project. 
Discussion of the various business and ownership models that might qualify follows below, and 
Section 8.5.1 offers further detail regarding eligibility to be considered an energy sovereignty project 
and the associated program benefits.  
The  Agency  recognizes  that  low-income  households  may  encounter  a  number  of  barriers  to 
ownership of both distributed generation and community solar projects.  Low-income households 
may lack savings to buy systems outright, they may not have a credit score high enough to enable 
financing, they may not own their dwelling, and their home may need electrical or structural 
upgrades to enable installation of solar.   
A further impediment—for individuals, non-profits, public agencies, schools, and others—is the 
structure of federal tax incentives. Investments in community solar are eligible for the Section 48 
investment tax credit and accelerated depreciation,453 which can only be applied against taxes on 
passive (investment) income.454 The Section 25D residential solar tax credit,455 for rooftop solar 
panels, is claimed against income tax, but cannot be refunded to taxpayers with insufficient taxable 
income.  As a result, solar projects often require a “tax equity” partner who can monetize federal tax 
credits and depreciation. This combination of incentives can be worth over 40% of the upfront 
investment in a commercial solar project.456  To attain ownership, the tax equity partner or third-
party owner (“TPO”) can sell or “flip” ownership to the other party after 5-7 years, when the main 
financial incentives have been captured. The details and mechanisms vary for the two types of 
deployment: on-site solar or remote community solar.457 
On-site systems are either owned by the customer and financed using a cash purchase or a loan, or 
they are owned by a TPO with the system leased to the customer or the power sold to the customer 
through a power purchase agreement (“PPA”).458 In the Illinois Solar for All Program to date, most 
Low-income Distributed Generation installations have been leased to eligible customers.  A common 
method of transferring ownership in such circumstances is an early buyout (“EBO”) of a lease or PPA.   
Community solar projects are typically owned by a for-profit developer, often in conjunction with a 
tax equity partner who is able to take advantage of federal incentives. This partnership sells 
subscriptions to customers, but usually retains ownership.  Alternative models that would lead to 
greater community ownership and control could include: ownership by local businesses or investors 
with  sufficient  tax  appetite  to  monetize  incentives;    by  local  non-taxable  entities  such  as 
governments, community choice energy aggregators, non-profit businesses or organizations, and 
cooperatives, in conjunction with a tax equity partner; or, by a for-profit (and taxable) subsidiary of

457 After the Commission’s approval of this 2022 Plan, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act legislation, which includes several 
changes to federal tax credits for solar installations. The Agency is still reviewing these changes to see how they might impact financing for 
energy sovereignty projects.

a non-profit entity, created specifically to own the solar project; or by some combination of partners. 
As with distributed generation, a transfer of ownership after 5-7 years would enable ownership of 
community solar by a community organization.  
For ownership of community solar by individuals, two strategies are currently being applied in the 
United States: owning shares in a community solar cooperative459 or owning parts of a community 
solar installation.460 Individuals could also own shares in a corporation that owns a community solar 
project. But creating a corporate structure that complies with Securities and Exchange Commission 
regulations on public ownership can be an onerous financial burden for what would be a small 
company.  The Agency will conduct a stakeholder engagement process to identify various ownership 
models for community solar projects and incorporate that feedback into eligibility guidelines for 
community solar projects to qualify as promoting energy sovereignty.461 
Related to the Agency’s consideration of models for energy sovereignty, Public Act 102-0662 enacted 
the  Energy Transition  Act,  which  established  the  Community Solar  Energy  Sovereignty  Grant 
Program (Section 5-60 of the Energy Transition Act), to be administered by DCEO. The Sovereignty 
Grant Program shall support “applicants that best demonstrate the ability and intent to create 
community ownership and other local community benefits, including local community wealth 
building via community renewable generation projects.” The Agency recognizes the potential for 
positive interactions between this Grant Program and the Illinois Solar for All Program and will work 
with DCEO to maximize such benefits. 
8.3. Program Launch and Experience to Date 
In implementing the various new programs and procurements mandated by Public Act 99-0906 (and 
now updated by Public Act 102-0662), the Agency had a large and varied set of new tasks to 
undertake. The Agency appreciates the strong interest in the Illinois Solar for All Program and desire 
to make the benefits of the Program available to low-income households and communities so that 
they can benefit from lower energy costs. The Illinois Solar for All Program as originally proposed in 
Public Act 99-0906 mostly builds on the Adjustable Block Program described in Chapter 7; therefore, 
it was necessary to first have the Adjustable Block Program’s design finalized and put into operation 
before the Illinois Solar for All Program launched. Like with the Adjustable Block Program, while the 
Initial Plan and First Revised Plan detailed many programmatic considerations, final program design 
including contracts, program manuals, etc. needed to be developed and finalized by the Agency and 
the Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator(s) prior to program launch.  
 
459 Customers would own shares in a community solar cooperative or corporation. Cooperative Energy Futures (“CEF”) in Minnesota has 
950 member-owners and owns 6.9 MW of solar in eight projects. Members pay $25 to join the co-op, and can subscribe to take solar 
electricity via virtual net metering. They can also participate in energy efficiency programs or buy preferred stock in the co-op when it is 
offered. Like a standard solar company, the co-op teams up with a tax equity partner to capture tax benefits, with majority ownership then 
flipped to the co-op, in effect managing tax issues for its customer/owners. 
460 Customers can own solar panels in a community solar project.  This approach is being used by a community solar cooperative in the 
Northeast US, Co-Op Power, and by publicly-owned utilities in Colorado and Kansas. In this case, the customer buys and owns the panels 
and is responsible for monetizing tax credits, selling or retaining renewable energy credits (in some states), and paying the project manager 
for system operations and maintenance. The customer gets the value of the electricity as a bill credit and can sell ownership in their panels 
to other utility customers or co-op members. Owning the panels directly requires individual owners to be able to use the tax credits, which 
may be an impediment for low-income customers. However, that model could also include a taxable partner and a transfer of ownership, 
such as through a lease with an early buyout option.

In  November  2018,  the  Agency  and  Program  Administrator  initiated  a  series  of  stakeholder 
engagement sessions to share draft program details with the public and invite written feedback, 
which  was  considered  in  planning  the  implementation  of  the  Illinois  Solar  for  All  Program.  
Stakeholder feedback sessions were held on a number of topics, including Environmental Justice 
Communities,  Job  Training,  Approved  Vendor  Registration,  Grassroots  Education,  Third  Party 
Program  Evaluation,  Consumer  Protection,  and  Project  and  Participant  Eligibility.    These 
opportunities to engage the public helped ensure that the process of finalizing program protocols 
and requirements was transparent and responsive to input from stakeholders from the solar 
industry, environmental advocates, and low-income advocates. 
The program began accepting applications for registering Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors on 
February 19, 2019, and opened for project applications on May 15, 2019. Due to anticipated high 
interest in the program’s incentives for new low-income solar installations, the program launch 
included an initial project application window for the 2018-2019 program year of 30 days for Low-
Income Community Solar projects and 45 days for Low-Income Distributed Generation and Non-
Profit/Public Facilities projects. Forty-five Low-Income Community Solar applications (totaling 
nearly 60 MW of capacity), 28 Non-Profit/Public Facilities applications (totaling over 3 MW of 
capacity), and one Low-Income Distributed Generation application (2 MW of capacity) applied during 
that initial window. The applications for Low-Income Community Solar and Non-Profit/Public 
Facility projects exceeded allocated sub-program budgets for the program year, while the Low-
Income Distributed Generation sub-program featured application levels below the allocated sub-
program budget.  Five Low-Income Community Solar projects (totaling 4 MW of capacity), and seven 
Non-Profit/Public Facility projects (1.3 MW of capacity) were selected. The community solar projects 
were selected using the project selection protocol (as discussed further in Section 8.10.2) while all 
the eligible Non-Profit/Public Facility projects were selected (the volume of project applications in 
that sub-program dropped below the annual sub-program budget after some were deemed ineligible 
during review). The one distributed generation applicant project withdrew.  In the latter two sub-
programs, unused 2018-2019 sub-program budget was rolled over to the respective 2019-2020 sub-
program budget. 
For the 2019-2020 Program Year, 30 Low-Income Community Solar projects (54.5 MW), 20 Non-
Profit/Public Facilities projects (2.7 MW), and 11 Low-Income Distributed Generation projects (2 
MW) applied during the initial project application window. Eligible applications for Low-Income 
Community Solar projects exceeded the allocated sub-program budget for that program year, so the 
project selection protocol was executed for the Low-Income Community Solar sub-program. Four 
community solar projects were selected (totaling 4 MW of capacity).  The Non-Profit/Public Facilities 
sub-program reopened on October 25, 2019 for rolling project applications and closed on February 
26, 2020 after 24 projects (totaling 2.8 MW of capacity) were approved for the program year.  
Applications for the Low-Income Distributed Generation sub-program did not fill the available 
budget and that sub-program reopened for rolling project applications on October 1, 2019.  One 
multi-family (2 MW) and nine single-family distributed generation projects (totaling 58 kW) were 
approved by the ICC before the program closed on May 31, 2020.   
For the 2020-2021 Program Year, 17 Low-Income Community Solar projects (over 35 MW), 33 Non-
Profit/Public Facilities projects (4.9 MW), and 7 multi-family unit (0.354 MW) were submitted during 
the initial project application windows. Eligible applications for Low-Income Community solar 
projects exceeded the allocated sub-program budget for the program year, so the project selection

protocol was executed for the Low-Income Community Solar program.  Three community solar 
projects were selected (totaling 4.5 MW of capacity).  Eligible applications for the Non-Profit/Public 
Facilities sub-program also exceeded the allocated sub-program budget for the program year, so the 
project selection protocol was executed and 18 projects (2.4 MW) were selected, and an additional 
project (0.3 MW) from the waitlist was able to be approved when funding was made available 
following  a  project  withdrawal  from  the  program.    Again,  applications  for  the  Low-Income 
Distributed Generation sub-program did not fill the available budget and reopened for rolling project 
applications on July 20, 2020.  A total of nine multi-family units (0.424 MW) and 53 single-family 
distributed generation projects (0.295 MW), totaling 0.719 MW, were approved by the ICC before the 
program year closed on May 31, 2021.

For the 2021-2022 Program Year, 162 Distributed Generation Projects totaling 1,321.71 kW (160 
single-family and small multifamily, and 2 5+ unit multifamily) applied before the program year 
ended on May 31, 2022. Forty-eight Non-Profit/Public Facilities Projects (5.8 MW) applied during 
the initial application window and eligible applications exceeded the allocated sub-program budget 
for the program year. Project selection occurred on August 11, 2021 and 20 Projects (2.4 MW) were 
selected (two projects had incentive values larger than the remaining funds and needed to resize 
their projects or accept a lesser incentive value, and one eventually withdrew). All twenty of those 
projects were approved by the ICC, although three withdrew after ICC approval, leaving a total 
capacity of 2.1 MW in the 17 remaining approved projects.  Ten projects on the waitlist that were 
eligible for the additional funding, and all were approved by the ICC, but one of those later withdrew. 
A rolling submission window opened on March 21, 2022 to provide an opportunity for additional 
Non-Profit/Public Facilities projects to be submitted to utilize the additional Utility funding made 
available by Public Act 102-0662, described in Section 8.4.3.  Seventy-two total Non-profit/Public 
Facilities projects were submitted and 41 were found eligible and approved by the ICC for a total of 
5.619  MW.  The  program  year  application  window  for  low-income  community  solar  project

projects exceeded the allocated sub-program budget. Project selection was conducted on October 27, 
2021 resulting in the selection of three projects (4.4 MW), which were approved by the ICC on 
November 18, 2021.  Two projects withdrew, each at 1,950 kW, and the remaining project is 500 kW.  
Six projects were on the waitlist and were eligible for the additional funding described in Section 
8.4.3.  Five of those projects (6.905 MW) were approved by the ICC.  In total, 6 community solar 
projects totaling 7.405 MW were approved and funded within the Program Year. 
8.4.  Funding and Budget 
The Illinois Solar for All Program is funded through three sources. First, the Renewable Energy 
Resources Fund pursuant to Section 1-56(b)(2) of the IPA Act; second, funds from the renewable 
energy resources budgets of the utilities pursuant to Section 1-75(c)(1)(O) of the IPA Act; and third, 
potential additional funds from the renewable resources budgets of the utilities pursuant to Section 
16-108(k) of the Public Utilities Act. 
8.4.1.  Funding 
Section 1-56(b)(2) envisions the Illinois Solar for All Program being funded through the state-held 
Renewable Energy Resources Fund and from the utility RPS budgets. As of August 23, 2022, the 
balance of the Renewable Energy Resources Fund is $128,888,591,462 while existing commitments 
from the Fund for contracts from the Supplemental Photovoltaic Procurements total $2.5 million463 
and for Illinois Solar for All from the first three program years, $47.7 million. This implies $78.7 
million of RERF funds remain available for Illinois Solar for All.  Prior to the 2018-2019 program year 
(i.e., at the outset of the Program), before the Agency had paid any administrative costs to its Program 
Administrator, $150.0 million of RERF funds were available for Illinois Solar for All; this is the figure 
the Agency will use in this Section in explaining sub-program allocations from the RERF.   
Prior to the enactment of Public Act 99-0906, the Renewable Energy Resources Fund received 
Alternative Compliance Payments each fall from Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers as part of their 
RPS compliance obligations. Under the revisions to Section 16-115D of the PUA contained in Public 
Act 99-0906, those payments were no longer made to the Fund as of June 1, 2017; rather, they were 
now made to the utilities, and were be paid to the utilities through Fall 2019.464 With those payments 
no longer being made into the RERF, there is no new revenue that will be deposited into the Fund.  
The RERF’s previously lower balance was due to the fact that on August 10, 2017, $150 million was 
transferred from the Renewable Energy Resources Fund to the General Revenue Fund pursuant to 
the borrowing provisions contained in Section 5h.5 of the State Finance Act.465 Thirty-seven and a 
half million dollars was paid back into the RERF in April of 2019,466 and the remainder of borrowed 
funds are required by law to be paid back to the Renewable Energy Resources Fund within five years 
 
462 This balance reflects the repayment of funds that had been lent to the state’s General Revenue Fund and Health Insurance Reserve 
Fund, as discussed below. 
463  The commitments consist of REC delivery contracts previously entered into and are being paid, or will be paid, over a five-year REC 
delivery schedule (invoiced quarterly) depending on when individual systems under contract were completed and began REC deliveries. 
464 See 220 ILCS 5/16-115D(i); after May 31, 2019, the ARES will no longer have any future Alternative Compliance Payment obligations, 
although “alternative retail electric suppliers and electric utilities operating outside their service territories shall be obligated to make all 
alternative compliance payments that they were obligated to pay for periods through and including May 31, 2019, but were not paid as of 
that date.” Those payments are due to by September 1, 2019.

(i.e., by August 10, 2022).467  As described above, two additional transfers of $10 million were also 
made in 2020 under this same authority. Repayments into the Fund have been made including $4 
million in September 2021, $10 million in December 2021, $10 million in January 2022, and the 
remaining balance of $108.5 million in March 2022.   
Section 5h.5(b) contains a provision that when the RERF (or for that matter other state funds that 
had similar transfers),   
ha[s] insufficient cash from which the State Comptroller may make expenditures 
properly supported by appropriations from the fund, then the State Treasurer and State 
Comptroller shall transfer from general funds to the fund only such amount as is 
immediately necessary to satisfy outstanding expenditure obligations on a timely basis. 
Likewise, that Section also provides for, 
continuing authority for and direction to the State Treasurer and State Comptroller to 
reimburse the funds of origin from general funds by transferring to the funds of origin, 
at such times and in such amounts as directed by the Comptroller when necessary to 
support appropriated expenditures from the funds, an amount equal to that transferred 
from them plus any interest that would have accrued thereon had the transfer not 
occurred…   
While those borrowed funds have been repaid, should there be future borrowing under these 
provisions and the RERF balance became insufficient for payments under any new contractual 
obligations, these provisions would allow the Agency to make expenditures from the RERF prior to 
the repayment of the transferred amount—i.e., to operate as though the RERF’s balance were at its 
original amount, even if transferred funds have not yet been moved back into the RERF. In addition, 
the Agency understands that the State Comptroller will coordinate with the Agency to make sure that 
any appropriated expenditures that the Agency makes through new contractual commitments are 
honored by ensuring that the balance of the RERF is at all times sufficient to make timely payments 
on contracts. While the Agency understands that these transfers from the RERF have caused 
consternation, based on the assurances contained in the law, it does not believe that the transfers 
necessitate any adjustments to its proposed Illinois Solar for All program design, structure, and 
budget. 
8.4.2.  Illinois Solar for All program design, structure, and budget  
For the Low-Income Distributed Generation Initiative, the Low-Income Community Solar Project 
Initiative, and Incentives for Non-Profits and Public Facilities sub-programs the Agency plans to 
allocate up to $16.5 million per program year from the RERF for use for the Illinois Solar for All 
Program (the Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Projects sub-program is conducted through a 
different process that allocates funds to each procurement event rather than program year).468 In the 
First Revised Plan, the Agency clarified that this allocation will be on an accrual basis, meaning that 
the amount allocated sets aside that much funding for selected applications during that program year, 
but are likely to actually be expended in future years in many cases due to the development timeline 
 
467 Section 5h.5 was initially created by Public Act 100-0023 and set the repayment time at two years from initial transfer. This transfer-
back deadline was subsequently amended to four years by Public Act 101-0010 and then to five years by Public Act 102-0016. 
468 As stated in Section 2.6.1, a program year for ILSFA corresponds to an energy delivery year and thus starts June 1 of each year. Therefore, 
a program year starts one month earlier than the state fiscal year, which begins July 1.

* RERF funds not allocated within a sub-program for a program year will roll over to the next program year for that same 
sub-program. 
Allocations are based on $150 million of the RERF available for Illinois Solar for All at the time of the 
Initial Plan development, and assume continuing level support from the RERF for the three non-pilot 
sub-programs in the 2022-2023, 2023-2024, and 2024-2025 program years (which, if fully allocated, 
would eventually deplete the RERF, leaving only utility-supplied funding available for program years 
after 2024-2025). 
The funds allocated from the RERF are allocated according to the percentages specified in Section 1-
56(b)(2) of the Act as modified by Public Act 102-0662, namely 35% combined for the Low-income 
Single-Family and Small Multifamily Incentive and the Low-income Large Multifamily Solar Incentive 
sub-programs, 40% to the Low-Income Community Solar Project Initiative sub-program, and 25% 
for the Incentives for non-profits and public facilities sub-program. 
Prior to the enactment of Public Act 102-0662, Section 1-56(b)(2)(D) set aside 25% of the RERF for 
Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Projects, which was $37.5 million. As discussed further in Section 
8.5.7, the Agency set a budget of $20 million for the first Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Project 
procurement held in December 2019 and two projects were selected. Public Act 102-0662 repealed 
this subsection and there will be no subsequent procurements.  
After  accounting  for  all  payments  under  the  Supplemental  Photovoltaic  Procurement  process 
pursuant to Section 1-56(i) of the IPA Act, as well as all payments under Illinois Solar for All contracts, 
whenever the balance of the RERF falls under $5,000, then the RERF shall be inoperative and any 
remaining funds shall be transferred to the Supplemental Low-Income Energy Assistance Fund for 
 
469 The annual RERF sub-program budgets stated above are gross budgets before deducting administrative, evaluation, & grassroots 
education costs; the budgets actually available for REC incentives will be net of those costs. 
470 This includes both the Low-income Single-Family and Small Multifamily Incentive and the Low-income Large Multifamily Solar 
Incentive. 
471 This includes $20,000,000 allocated to Low-income Community Solar Pilot Procurement projects from the procurement conducted in 
2019. That sub-program of Illinois Solar for All was repealed by Public Act 102-0662.

8.4.3.  Utilities Annual Funding Available 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(O) under Public Act 99-0906 contained a provision that allocated the greater of 
$10 million or 5% of “fund available under the plan” to Illinois Solar for All. Under Public Act 102-
0662, this language was updated: 
The long-term renewable resources procurement plan shall allocate up to $50,000,000 
per delivery year to fund the programs, and the plan shall determine the amount of 
funding to be apportioned to the programs identified in subsection (b) of Section 1-56 
of this Act; provided that for the delivery years beginning June 1, 2021, June 1, 2022, and 
June 1, 2023, the long-term renewable resources procurement plan may average the 
annual budgets over a 3-year period to account for program ramp-up. For the delivery 
years beginning June 1, 2021, June 1, 2024, June 1, 2027, and June 1, 2030 and [sic] 
additional $10,000,000 shall be provided to the Department of Commerce and Economic 
Opportunity to implement the workforce development programs and reporting as 
outlined in Section 16-108.12 of the Public Utilities Act.  
As discussed in Section 2.9.1, the Agency understands the above statutory provision to refer to funds 
collected by utilities through RPS riders under Section 1-75(c)(6) of the Act and Section 16-108(k) of 
the PUA. Public Act 102-0662 increased the previous $10,000,000 annual allocation of utility funds 
to $50,000,000. For the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 delivery years, the Agency is allowed 
to determine the allocation to allow for a ramping up at an average of $50,000,000 per year for those 
three program years, then will allocate $50,000,000 each year towards Illinois Solar for All.  
As the 2021-2022 delivery year was already underway when Public Act 102-0662 was enacted, it 
raised the question of how the annual allocation of utility funding for the 2022-2023 delivery year 
had already been established through the Revised Long-Term Plan approved by the Commission in 
2020. On January 10, 2022 the Agency filed a petition with the Illinois Commerce Commission 
seeking to have a limited reopening of the Revised Long-Term Plan to update the 2022-2023 delivery 
budget year allocation of utility RPS funds to conform with Public Act 102-0662.473 To maximize 
opportunities in the Illinois Solar for All Program the Agency proposed an immediate ramp-up to $50 
million. The Commission approved the IPA’s petition on March 3, 2022, and the current Illinois Solar 
for All budget has been updated accordingly. As a result of this funding increase a rolling submission 
window for the Non-Profit/Public Facility category opened on March 21, 2022, to accommodate the 
additional subprogram budget and accepted project submissions through the end of the 2021-2022 
Program Year on May 31, 2022.  
For the 2022-2023 and 2023-2034 delivery years the Agency will continue allocating $50 million per 
year from utility collected fund. 
These funds are supplied by each utility based on the allocation percentages contained in Section 
3.4.1.

Section 1-56(b)(2), as updated by Public Act 102-0662, now requires that utility funding initially be 
allocated to the sub-programs at the same percentages as the RERF funds, as dictated by that same 
section (35% combined allocation to the Low-income Single Family and Small Multifamily Solar and 
the Low-income Multifamily Solar sub-programs, 40% to the Low-Income Community Solar Project 
Initiative, and 25% to Incentives for Non-Profits and Public Facilities).  In this 2022 Plan, the Agency 
will continue the approach described in the Initial Plan and now required under Section 1-56(b)(2) 
for the 2021-2022 program year. As this allocation of utility funding to the sub-programs is not 
required by law after the initial allocation, the Agency may adjust utility funding between those sub-
programs on an as-needed basis after the 2022-2023 program year if there are available funds in one 
sub-program and higher demand in another sub-program, with the exception that funds for the 
Distributed Generation sub-program will not be reallocated.474  
For each of the sub-programs, approved project applications within a program year will be first 
funded by the utility funds, and then by the RERF funds. The reason for this approach is that utility 
funds are that not spent within five years of when they are collected may be returned to ratepayers 
through a reconciliation process,475 while RERF funds are not subject to the same reconciliation and 
refund mechanism.  Unallocated RERF funds within a sub-program from each program year would 
be rolled over to the following program year. 
The funding for job training programs provided by the Department of Commerce and Economic 
Opportunity (“DCEO”) under Section 16-108.12 of the PUA is noted in the budget discussion in 
Chapter 3. As those funds are not directly part of the Illinois Solar for All Program as managed by the 
Agency, those funds are not included in this budget discussion. (The intersection between the Illinois 
Solar for All Program and the job training programs is discussed in Section 8.9.1) 
8.4.4.  Section 16-108(k) Funding (Now Inoperable) 
Prior  to  the  enactment  of  Public  Act  102-0662,  Section  16-108(k)  of  the  Public  Utilities  Act 
contemplated a possible situation in which the total amount of funds appropriated by the General 
Assembly from the Renewable Energy Resources Fund during the period between June 1, 2017 and 
August 1, 2018 is less than $200,000,000, creating a “funding shortfall” and a mechanism to 
potentially address that shortfall.  This provision has now been removed from Section 16-108(k). For 
a discussion of this now inoperable mechanism, please refer to Section 8.4.3 of previous versions of 
the Long-Term Plan. 
8.4.5.  Setting Budgets 
The Agency has developed the Illinois Solar for All Program under the assumption that the funds 
available for the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 delivery years will be funds from the RERF and the 
utility-supplied funds identified in Section 8.4.3.  Table 8-2 provides a summary of the Illinois Solar 
for All funding.   
As discussed in Section 8.5.1, 25% of funds in each sub-program category will be reserved for the 
Energy Sovereignty Fund that is intended to promote ownership for eligible customers.

8.4.6.  Payment Structure 
The Illinois Solar for All Program is structured so that the Agency “may pay for such renewable 
energy credits through an upfront payment per installed kilowatt of nameplate capacity paid once 
the device is interconnected at the distribution system level of the interconnecting utility and verified 
as energized.”477  Section 7.10.5 describes the options for the capacity factor used in the Adjustable 
Block Program to convert kilowatt size of a project to the number of RECs the system would be 
expected to generate over 15 years and those same options apply to Illinois Solar for All. For each 
approved system, the Program Administrator will calculate a 15-year REC delivery quantity. Illinois 
Solar for All Approved Vendors will have the option of using a PVWatts calculated capacity factor 
(stated relative to a system’s nameplate capacity in AC rating) automatically computed by the 
application platform, or propose an alternative capacity factor based upon an analysis conducted 
using an equivalent tool. Alternative capacity factors may be proposed as part of each system’s 
application and will be subject to review and approval by the Program Administrator. Systems using 
bifacial panels must submit an alternative capacity factor subject to review and approval by the 
Program Administrator. All capacity factors submitted must be for a system’s first year; as stated 
below, annual REC delivery commitments will incorporate a 0.5% per year degradation factor.  
Payments for Illinois Solar for All incentives take the form of upfront payments upon energization of 
systems, with the similar conditions as the Adjustable Block Program that a system must also be 
registered in GATS or M-RETS to verify that it will produce RECs.  
 
476 As noted above in Section 8.4, the RERF sub-program funding amounts are gross budgets before deduction of administrative costs.  
Additionally, there could be unused utility funds and/or RERF funds from the sub-program budgets for 2018-2019 through 2021-2022 
that are rolled over to 2022-2023.

REC delivery contracts are either with the Agency or an electric utility, depending on the funding 
source,478 and include the assignment of RECs from each system for 15 years. RECs from these 
contracts are applied to the annual RPS goals of the utility to which the project is interconnected, but 
do not count toward each utility’s new photovoltaic project targets.479 Projects that receive a contract 
through Illinois Solar for All are not eligible also to receive a contract through the Adjustable Block 
Program.480 
Contracts with the Agency (that utilize funds from the RERF) are standard contracts that include 
required state contract provisions—such as terms, conditions, and attachments—including a clause 
stating that payment is subject to appropriation. Contracts with the utilities may have similarities, 
but vary given the different requirements applicable to each.481 Similar to what was discussed in 
Section 7.14 regarding contracts for the Adjustable Block Program, the Agency published standard 
REC delivery contracts (one for the Agency as counterparty and one for a utility as counterparty) for 
Illinois Solar for All in May 2019; following the approval of the First Revised Plan the Agency updated 
the Illinois Solar for All REC contract structure following the concepts included in Section 7.13, 
including updates to the payment withholding in lieu of collateral option as discussed in Section 
7.12.1. This new contract was implemented beginning in the fourth program year, 2021-2022.   The 
Agency will again update the Illinois Solar for All REC contract in order to implement changes to 
program requirements in accordance with the Commission’s approval of this Plan in ICC Docket No. 
22-0231. 
The Act is silent on how to allocate RECs from projects located in the service territories of municipal 
utilities, rural electric cooperatives, or Mt. Carmel Public Utility. The Agency does not apply RECs 
from those projects procured through contracts with the Agency using the RERF to the utility RPS 
goals, while any RECs procured through contracts with a utility are applied to the RPS goals of the 
contracting utility.482 
8.5. Program Requirements and Incentives 
Section 1-56(b)(2) outlines four sub-programs of the Illinois Solar for All Program: 
1.  Low-Income Single-Family and Small Multifamily Solar 
2.  Low-Income Community Solar Project Initiative 
3.  Incentives for Non-Profits and Public Facilities 
4.  Low-income large multifamily solar 
 
478 See 20 ILCS 3855/1-56(b)(2). (“Contracts that will be paid with funds in the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resources Fund 
shall be executed by the Agency. Contracts that will be paid with funds collected by an electric utility shall be executed by the electric 
utility.”) 
479 See id. 
480 Section 1-56(b)(3) of the IPA Act requires that for Illinois Solar for All contracts, “[p]ayments for renewable energy credits shall be in 
exchange for all renewable energy credits generated by the system during the first 15 years of operation.” Sections 1-75(c)(1)(L)(ii) and 
(iii) both contain provisions related to the various components of the Adjustable Block Program that, “[t]he electric utility shall receive and 
retire all renewable energy credits generated by the project for the first 15 years of operation.” These two provisions from Section 1-
56(b)(3) and Section 1-75(c)(1)(L) are mutually exclusive as only one REC can be produced, transferred, and retired for each MWh of 
generation. 
481 See Docket No. 17-0838, Final Order dated April 3, 2018 at 151-152.   
482 To date no approved Illinois Solar for All projects are located in the service territories of rural electrical cooperatives or municipal 
utilities.

These sub-programs provide an incentive based on the price per REC from the Adjustable Block 
Program, with adjustments to that price as described below to account for the specific needs of the 
Illinois Solar for All Program. The Low-Income Distributed Generation Incentive sub-program was 
divided by Public Act 102-0662 into two separate sub-programs, the Low-Income Single-Family and 
Small Multifamily Solar sub-program, and the Low-income Large Multifamily Solar sub-program.  
In addition to the four Illinois Solar for All sub-programs, Section 1-56(b)(4) of the Act allows some 
flexibility  to  propose  changes  that  “more  effectively  maximizes  the  benefits  to  low-income 
customers"": 
In the course of the Commission proceeding initiated to review and approve the plan, 
including the Illinois Solar for All Program proposed by the Agency, a party may propose 
an additional low-income solar or solar incentive program, or modifications to the 
programs proposed by the Agency, and the Commission may approve an additional 
program, or modifications to the Agency's proposed program, if the additional or 
modified program more effectively maximizes the benefits to low-income customers 
after taking into account all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the extent to 
which a competitive market for low-income solar has developed.483  
Section 1-56(b)(2) as amended by Public Act 102-0662 also states: 
In addition to the programs outlined in paragraphs (A) through (E), the Agency and 
other parties may propose additional programs through the Long-Term Renewable 
Resources  Procurement  Plan  developed  and  approved  under  paragraph  (5)  of 
subsection (b) of Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. Additional programs may 
target market segments not specified above and may also include incentives targeted to 
increase  the  uptake  of  nonphotovoltaic  technologies  by  low-income  customers, 
including energy storage paired with photovoltaics, if the Commission determines that 
the Illinois Solar for All Program would provide greater benefits to the public health and 
well-being of low-income residents through also supporting that additional program 
versus supporting programs already authorized. 
The Agency is implementing two pilots addressing barriers expressed by stakeholders: 
•  The first pilot, described in Section 8.5.3.3, provides additional incentives for the home 
repairs and upgrades necessary to install solar on homes that are eligible for the Low-Income 
Single-Family and Small Multifamily Solar Program. 
 
•  Section 8.5.3.4 describes the second pilot, which will focus on reaching areas underserved by 
ILSFA, in which the Program Administrator will assume the majority of the customer-
interaction and public outreach functions.  Selection will prioritize Small and Emerging 
Vendors. 
8.5.1.  Energy Sovereignty 
As noted above in Section 8.2.4, Section 1-56(b)(2)(A)(i) of the IPA Act requires the Agency to reserve 
“a portion” of Illinois Solar for All “for projects that promote energy sovereignty through ownership 
 
483 20 ILCS 3855/1-56(b)(4).

240,248,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
of projects” by eligible entities. The Agency defines terms, provides analysis, and outlines here a 
number of measures  to  incorporate  ownership policies into  the  four  sub-programs of ILSFA.  
Additional research and discussion of energy sovereignty is provided in Appendix G. 
The Agency will reserve one-quarter (25%) of the funds in each of the four sub-program budgets for 
projects that promote energy sovereignty, with an additional bonus for distributed solar projects. 
Projects that feature or facilitate ownership of projects by low-income households or other entities 
listed in Section 1-56(b)(2)(A)(i) meet this requirement.  Projects where the low-income household 
or eligible entity holds majority ownership of the installation from the time of project application will 
automatically qualify as promoting energy sovereignty. For projects claiming to “facilitate” energy 
sovereignty, the Agency will examine the project ownership model, as discussed below.  
Ownership facilitation models that would likely meet this standard are best understood as falling 
into two categories: on-site projects that are on the customer’s property, serving 1-4 units of housing, 
5+ units of housing, or non-profits and public facilities; or remotely located community solar projects.  
Section 1-56(3) of the IPA Act requires Illinois Solar for All incentives to be paid upon energization 
of a project, providing an upfront payment to the project developer, who then delivers ongoing 
services to the eligible customer.  Since models that involve the transfer of ownership after five to 
seven years are best able to capitalize on federal incentives, this poses a timing issue for promoting 
energy sovereignty.  Section 1-56(B)(2)(A)(i) of the Act does allow the Agency to “consider the 
inclusion of projects that promote ownership over time or that involve partial project ownership by 
communities, as promoting energy sovereignty.""  
To solve this timing issue, the Agency proposes the following strategies for the two ownership 
models, on-site and community solar. 
8.5.1.1.  On-Site Projects 
For on-site systems, the Agency will offer an adder of $10 per REC for projects that facilitate 
ownership through a transfer of ownership after project energization. As with all Illinois Solar for All 
REC contract payments, full payment will be due upon energization.  The REC contract for such 
projects will feature additional contract terms that require a transfer of ownership at a certain date, 
such as five to seven years after energization.  The Agency envisions that the TPO would have a 
contract for a lease or power purchase agreement with the customer that featured an early buyout 
clause at a given time and the Agency will develop a standard template for the requirements of the 
buyout clause.  
The incentives paid for energy sovereignty would be managed in one of two ways: they could be held 
back and used at the time of transfer to cover the cost of the buyout at fair market value, the cost of 
ongoing monitoring and maintenance after transfer of ownership, and the cost of equipment 
replacement for a certain period (perhaps up to 25 years); or they could be retained by the TPO with 
the contract featuring a buyout value at a commensurately lower price, and the TPO agreeing to 
provide services after transfer. 
The amount and apportionment of the ILSFA incentives would be adjusted to reflect the energy 
sovereignty adder. For example, if ownership is expected to be transferred at the end of year seven, 
the initial ILSFA incentive may be based on a seven-year value of RECs, with the remaining eight years 
including the energy sovereignty adder.  
240 
 ",8. Illinois Solar for All ,[],732,23,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
241,249,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
The Program Administrator must be notified of the transfer of ownership when it occurs along with 
documentation of how it adheres to the contract terms. The Agency, or contracting utility, would be 
able to claw back any ownership incentives if the transfer does not happen as expected.  
There are many permutations of customer types, building ownership structures, and solar business 
models. The Agency’s goal is to enable ownership for the greatest number of potential beneficiaries 
in a financially efficient manner, while maintaining consumer protections and delivering benefits to 
eligible  customers.  As  approaches  to  energy  sovereignty  are  implemented,  the  Program 
Administrator  will  consider  models  that  could  work  for  each  permutation.    The  Program 
Administrator will further keep records of transactions related to achieving energy sovereignty, 
including finances, costs and benefits, type of customers, and barriers encountered, to facilitate 
learning and program evaluation. 
8.5.1.2.  Community Solar 
Promoting ownership of off-site community solar projects by low-income households would require 
a different approach than on-site systems. As noted above in Section  8.2.2, community solar 
installations are eligible for different tax incentives and use different business models than on-site 
systems. 
To encourage energy sovereignty for community solar, the Agency could take the following actions:  
1.  Energy sovereignty payments could be used to pay for ownership shares in a community 
solar  cooperative  on  behalf  of  eligible  customers.  These  shares  would  entitle  the 
customer/owner to receive dividends and to subscribe to electricity from the project at a 
discounted rate, sufficient to meet bill savings requirements. The customer/owner would be 
able to sell the shares to other co-op members, or to the co-op itself. 
2.  As with on-site solar, energy sovereignty payments could be used to promote ownership of 
individual panels located at a community solar project. The funds could be used to transfer 
ownership to an eligible customer after tax benefits have been fully captured, such as through 
an early buyout of a lease or PPA. Energy sovereignty payments would be paid upfront, and 
either held in escrow to pay for the buyout or taken by the TPO and reflected in contract 
terms relating to an early buyout.    
The Agency will give a scoring preference to ILSFA community solar projects and set aside a 
minimum of 25% of the ILSFA Low-Income Community Solar subprogram budget for projects that 
result in ownership by customers. Given the highly competitive state of the Community Solar 
subprogram, the Agency believes this will sufficiently incentivize energy sovereignty projects. This 
prioritization will be applied after the prioritization for projects located in environmental justice 
communities. If an insufficient number of Energy Sovereignty awards are made to meet the 25% set-
aside within nine months after the deadline for program applications, the funds will be made 
available to community solar projects that do not feature energy sovereignty.  
The content of subscription agreements for subscribers to community solar projects featuring energy 
sovereignty will need to be reviewed and approved by the Program Administrator before being 
offered to customers. The Agency will encourage Approved Vendors to use a standard subscription 
agreement to minimize the level of administrative review. The Agency also reserves the right to 
perform a financial audit on a community solar cooperative that receives ILSFA support.  The 
Administrator will convene a stakeholder process to facilitate education about cooperatives, share

242,250,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
best practices, and develop standards for consumer disclosure, content for job training programs, 
and materials or templates to assist with cooperative startups. The Agency will collect and make 
public data on the number of energy sovereignty projects developed in each subprogram and 
reassess whether additional incentives are needed in the next Plan revision.  
In the version of this Plan filed for Commission approval, the Agency noted that while much of this 
analysis has focused on how to manage federal tax incentives, Congress may change to how 
renewable energy incentives are delivered. Subsequent to the approval of this Plan, the federal 
government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act on August 16, 2022.  The IPA will review the changes 
in federal law and, if necessary, revisit Illinois Solar for All program designs through appropriate 
means.  
These ownership strategies will be pursued in coordination with other programs created under 
Public Act 102-0662. The Agency is not the only agency tasked with promoting energy sovereignty, 
making interagency collaboration vital.   
The Community Solar Energy Sovereignty Program, part of the Jobs and Environmental Justice Grant 
Program created in Section 5-60 of the Energy Transition Act enacted through Public Act 102-0662, 
will be managed by the DCEO. The program will award grants to projects ""that best demonstrate the 
ability and intent to create community ownership and other local community benefits, including local 
community wealth building.” Grants can be awarded for a variety of business tasks as well as to 
support entities that would assist in ongoing operation, “such as community solar cooperatives."" 
Priority will be given to projects located in equity investment eligible communities and that provide 
“additional benefits for participating low-income households."" It is noted that the statute does not 
say that grants can be used to purchase systems for eligible entities, suggesting a complementary role 
for the incentives provided through Illinois Solar for All. 
Aside from budget updates to the 2021-2022 program year, as authorized by Public Act 102-0662, 
any changes (compared to the First Revised Plan) to sub-program terms and conditions, and other 
general aspects of Illinois Solar for All, described subsequently in this Chapter (as well as the 
budgetary discussion in Section 8.4 above) will be effective for the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 
program years and will not apply to the 2021-2022 program year which will have been completed 
by the time the Agency expects this 2022 Long-Term Plan to be approved by the Commission.  
As listed in Table 8-3, approximately $66.5 million is expected to be available in program years 2022-
2023 and 2023-2024, in addition to any unallocated funds rolled over from program year 2021-2022.  
8.5.2.  Setting Incentive Levels 
The incentive levels described in the following Sections were derived by utilizing the REC prices for 
the Adjustable Block Program as described in Section 7.5 and adjusting those prices to meet the 
objectives of the Illinois Solar for All Program. These incentives will be offered through a 15-year REC 
delivery contract, either with the Agency for projects funded with the Renewable Energy Resources 
Fund, or with a utility for projects funded through utility-supplied funds.  
Incentive levels are expressed as REC prices and are set according to the same groups and categories 
as the Adjustable Block Program (Group A for projects located in Ameren Illinois, Mt. Carmel, 
MidAmerican, and rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities located in MISO; Group B for 
projects located in ComEd, and rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities located in PJM). 
Unlike the Adjustable Block Program, these incentives have not been and will not be adjusted upward 
242 
 ",8. Illinois Solar for All ,[],742,21,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
243,251,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
or downward based upon blocks of capacity filling. Rather, the Agency proposes to review and update 
the incentive levels on an annual program year basis. That update will include an adjustment to 
account for how the comparable Adjustable Block Program REC price for each Group and category 
has changed since the previous update, allowing for the prices offered through Illinois Solar for All to 
track overall market conditions while continuing to be offered at a higher level than for the 
Adjustable Block Program.  
For this 2022 Plan, the Agency updated ILSFA REC Prices based on the modeling of the updated REC 
Pricing Model described in Chapter 7 and in Appendices D and E. The changes to REC Prices largely 
reflect changes to the underlying modeling used for the Adjustable Block Program that then flow 
through to Illinois Solar for All. This means that changes to Adjustable Block Program Prices that are 
adopted through the approval of this 2022 Plan will also then apply to ILSFA prices.  In accordance 
with the Commission’s Final Order approving this Plan, the 2022-2023 REC Prices were published 
on August 1, 2022.484 
In setting REC prices for the Low-Income Distributed Generation Incentive sub-program for the 
Initial Plan, the Agency adjusted the Adjustable Block Program’s REC prices in the CREST model by 
setting the assumed debt financing of the project to 0%, and increasing the net metering benefit 
shared with participants from 20% to (i) 100% for residential participants in 1-4 unit buildings and 
(ii) 50% for residential participants in larger buildings.485 For this 2022 Plan the Agency will increase 
the development costs component of the model for 1-4 unit buildings to 200% of the value used in 
the Adjustable Block Program to recognize the increased complexity of developing residential 
projects as part of Illinois Solar for All, especially the added costs of identifying and verifying eligible 
low-income customers. 
For the Low-Income Community Solar sub-program, the Adjustable Block Program REC prices were 
adjusted by shortening the financing term to five years and lowering the debt financing to 35%.  For 
the Incentives for Non-Profits and Public Facilities sub-program, REC prices were adjusted from the 
ABP DG pricing model by considering the project as a non-taxable entity; the up-to-10 kW size 
segment was assumed to be non-residential instead of residential; and the net metering benefit to be 
shared with participants was increased from 20% to 50%.  The Agency does not propose any 
adjustments to the REC price methodology for these two sub-programs for this 2022 Plan. 
The Agency believes these approaches represent reasonable proxies for the higher incentive level 
needed for Illinois Solar for All projects compared to Adjustable Block Program projects to overcome 
the financing barriers and other hurdles these project face. 
8.5.3.  Low-Income Single-Family and Small Multifamily Solar  
The Low-Income Distributed Generation Incentive sub-program, created in Public Act 99-0906, has 
been historically under-subscribed, spending less than its budget allowed. While participation in the 
sub-program continues to increase over time, funds in its budget remained unspent at the end of each 
program year.  Public Act 102-0662 introduced several changes to this subprogram in an effort to 
reduce barriers to participation and grow the low-income market for distributed generation.

244,252,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
The sub-program was created to provide funding for photovoltaic projects located on individual 
homes and multi-unit residential buildings. Public Act 102-0662 updated Section 1-56(b)(2), which 
lays out the Illinois Solar for All sub-program structure, creating separate sub-programs for projects 
serving single-family and two- to four-unit multifamily residences (the Single-Family and Small 
Multifamily category) and low-income residences with five or more units (the Large Multifamily 
category), and setting aside a portion of the program to encourage energy sovereignty.  Separate 
schedules of REC incentive prices were established for projects serving one-to-four-unit residences 
and 5+ unit multi-family buildings.  To ensure that large Low-Income Distributed Generation projects 
could not quickly exhaust the sub-program budget, 25% of the sub-program budget was reserved in 
a nine-month carveout to ensure opportunities for one-to-four-unit projects beginning in the 2020-
2021 program year.   
Additional  changes  enacted  by  P.A.  102-0662  include  the  additional  low-income  consumer 
protections outlined in Chapter 9 and Section 8.11 and funding set aside targeted to environmental 
justice communities (25% of each sub-program) and to projects promoting energy sovereignty (25% 
of each sub-program).  In approving and modifying the First Revised Plan, the Commission noted that 
multi-faceted challenges to participation in the Low-Income Distributed Generation sub-program 
must be addressed. The Agency and Program Administrator have worked with stakeholders to 
identify barriers to participation in this sub-program and continue to explore and implement 
adjustments to increase participation, lower soft costs, and simplify sales procedures.486  
For example, a referral process to generate greater participation was developed in fall of 2020 and 
stakeholder input was received through the end of that year. 487  The referral process and an income 
verification process for single-family homeowners were both implemented in mid-2021.   For this 
2022 Plan, the Agency clarifies that it interprets the Commission’s directive to implement such 
processes in a competitively neutral fashion to mean that the processes should not give advantage to 
one Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor or group of Approved Vendors over others, nor should 
they give the appearance of doing so.  Furthermore, the referral process will consider geography, 
availability of Approved Vendors serving single-family customers in a potential participant’s area, 
services provided, the efficiency of the process, and transparency of offers. 
Additional steps for streamlining the project submission process have been made for this 2022 Plan 
including: 
•  Extending the time period in which the Program Administrator-provided income verification 
is valid from 6 to 12 months (Section 8.10.4.1). 
•  Amending Section 8.11 to eliminate the requirement to present and sign the disclosure seven 
days prior to consummation of the contract along with an extension of the cancellation period 
to simplify the customer engagement process with one less touchpoint in the customer 
acquisition process. 
•  Reaffirming  the  Agency’s  commitment  to  more  closely  work  with  third-party  energy 
efficiency program administrator or community action agencies to facilitate connecting their 
participants to Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors and providing initial site suitability 
 
486 See Docket No. 19-0995, Final Order dated February 18, 2020 at 101. 
487 In response to concerns raised by various stakeholders in the process of approving the First Revised Plan, the Commission determined 
that the Agency and the Program Administrator shall explore implementing a process to connect interested income-qualified customers 
with Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors, and that the Agency must implement any such process in a competitively neutral fashion.  
(Docket No. 19-0995, Final Order dated February 18, 2020 at 108.)  This referral program implements that directive. 
244

screening where applicable (Section 8.8.3). As detailed in Section 8.15, the Agency interprets 
expanded language in Section 1-56(b)(3) of the IPA Act as amended by Public Act 102-0662 
to allow grassroots education funding to support activities beyond the community education 
campaigns funded to date. 
•  Removing the minimum batch requirement (Section 8.10.1) and making the ILSFA and ABP 
portals simpler and more uniform with each other. 
•  Redesigning the disclosure forms for ILSFA and ABP to shorten and simplify the documents. 
The Agency is hopeful that these changes will help to lower soft costs and encourage increased 
participation  in  the  sub-program,  recognizing  that  of  the  identified  barriers  to  increasing 
participation  is  the  complexity  of  the  sub-program  and  confusion  or  mistrust  from  potential 
participants.   
Section 8.5.3.4 includes a proposed pilot to assess the impact of a more streamlined program model. 
In this pilot the Program Administrator will assume the majority of the customer-interaction and 
public outreach functions, such as recruiting customers, conducting income verification, partnering 
with local organizations, and liaising with job training and placement programs.  This pilot will focus 
on reaching areas underserved by Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors to date and will prioritize 
selection of Small and Emerging Vendors. 
To better understand where projects are stalling, the Agency will also improve the tracking and 
transparency of project processing metrics and will provide it as needed to the ILSFA Stakeholder 
Advisory Group described in Section 8.17.   This tracking will inform opportunities to improve the 
process and provide clear expectations to program participants. 
Beyond  these  improvements,  the  Agency  appreciates  the  stakeholder  recommendations  for 
streamlining the application submission process through the next update of the Illinois Solar for All 
Approved Vendor Manual.  The Agency and Program Administrator will seek stakeholder feedback 
in that update process. 
8.5.3.1.  Eligibility 
For single-family homes, households must verify that they are low-income; for two- to four-unit 
residential buildings, at least two of the households must be verified as low-income. In addition to 
projects being eligible based on household income, projects developed on homes or buildings that 
qualify for US Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) Project-Based Vouchers or 
Project-Based Rental Assistance (which are programs for housing units dedicated to low-income 
tenants) also qualify.  The income qualification levels required for participation in these programs 
are lower than income requirements for the Illinois Solar for All Program.  
Under the Revised Plan, to help ensure funding would be available for projects for 1-4 unit buildings, 
25% of the sub-program budget was carved out for 1-4 unit buildings projects for the first nine 
months of the program year, and any unobligated funds from that carveout was released for any Low-
Income Distributed Generation project for the final three months of the program year, and any 
unused sub-program funds would be rolled over to the following year’s sub-program budget.  In a 
similar fashion, for this 2022 Plan the Agency will hold the initial budget allocations for the Low-
Income Single and Small Multi-family and the Low-Income Large Multifamily Solar sub-programs for 
the first nine months of the program year, at which time the two sub-program allocations would 
combine to be used on a first-come, first-served basis by projects of either sub-program.  At the end 
245

of the program year, any unreserved sub-category funds will rollover to the total budget allocation 
for the Low-Income Single and Small Multi-family and the Low-Income Large Multifamily Solar sub-
programs for the following program year of Distributed Generation sub-program, in accordance with 
the Commission’s order in approving and modifying the Revised Plan.488  
8.5.3.2.  Incentive Level 
As discussed in Section 7.5, these REC prices are based on an update of the REC Pricing model 
developed for this 2022 Long-Term Plan.  
Table 8-3: Incentives for the Low-Income Single and Small Multifamily Solar 
Program($/REC)489

>25 kW – 100 kW  $107.10  3.7%  $108.51  5.1% 
 
To encourage Energy Sovereignty, an additional $10 per REC would be added for projects that result 
in ownership by the customer, such as through an early buyout of a lease or PPA.  
These incentive payments are intended to be sufficient to provide tangible economic benefits to 
participants through enabling project developers to eliminate upfront costs to the participants for 
the installation of photovoltaic projects. The REC price is a standard incentive for the contractually 
obligated delivery of a renewable energy credit and not customized for each project. 
 
8.5.3.3.  Pilot Program on Home Repairs and Upgrades 
Program participants and stakeholders have reported that a number of customers who are eligible 
for ILSFA have been unable to participate in the program due to the need for home repairs and 
electric upgrades, which are a precondition for installation of solar panels.  While the ILSFA program 
was designed to support the installation of solar distributed generation, the Agency recognizes that 
low-income residents are more likely to face this impediment to participation and that it may be 
frustrating the overall objective of the program.  
Under  Section  1-56(b)(4)  of  the  IPA  Act,  the  Long-term  Plan  approval  process  may  include 
“additional low-income solar or solar incentive program, or modifications to the programs proposed 
by the Agency, and the Commission may approve an additional program, or modifications to the 
Agency's proposed program, if the additional or modified program more effectively maximizes the 
 
488 See Docket No. 19-0995, Final Order dated February 18, 2020 at 100-101. 
489 While theoretically projects for 1-4 unit buildings could be larger than 100 kW, the Agency does not believe that it is technically possible 
for a 4-unit project to exceed that size and thus only REC prices for up to 100 kW are displayed here. The REC pricing model included in 
Appendices D and E includes a full set of modeled REC prices for.

benefits to low-income customers after taking into account all relevant factors, including, but not 
limited to, the extent to which a competitive market for low-income solar has developed.”490 
The Agency has concluded that the creation of a pilot program in ILSFA to provide additional 
incentives for the home repairs and upgrades necessary to install solar on homes that are eligible for 
the  Low-Income  Single-Family  and  Small  Multifamily  Solar  Program  would  “more  effectively 
maximize[…] the benefits to low-income customers” provided by the Illinois Solar for All program.   
The Agency will seek input from stakeholders before finalizing the pilot program details. 
Eligible repairs and upgrades will be limited to actions required for solar photovoltaics installation 
on the premises, such as electrical work, breaker panel upgrades, and roof repairs, beyond those of a 
normal solar installation.  The Agency will review potential cost caps per project and limits on the 
number  of  projects  in  the  pilot  based  on  market  data  and  consultation  with  the  Program 
Administrator. 
Further, as part of the fact-finding nature of the pilot program,  the Agency and its Program 
Administrator will test ways to help the eligible customer seek funding from the various federal, 
state, and non-profit programs listed in Section 8.8.6.  If funding is not available in a timely manner 
from those programs, the pilot may support the projects.  The ability of other programs to fund 
repairs will be included in an evaluation of the pilot. 
8.5.3.4.  Program Delivery Pilot 
The operating structure of the Illinois Solar for All program is to offer incentives to competitive 
market actors to help low-income and other eligible customers access the benefits of solar power.  In 
some regards this approach has worked well, as sub-programs have quickly filled their allotted 
budgets and seen large amounts of solar developed, helping expand the commercial solar market in 
Illinois. 
However, the distributed generation sub-program has yet to achieve participation levels that fully 
leverage its annual budget. While participation levels have been increasing in the 2021-2022 
program year, Approved Vendors have reported a number of barriers to distributed solar, including 
customers unfamiliar with solar power or distrustful of marketers, structural impediments such as 
electrical systems and roofs in need of repair, language barriers, and a complex administrative 
process.  While this 2022 Plan includes a number of refinements to reduce barriers to participation, 
the Agency has determined that the Program may benefit from testing a more comprehensive change 
to see if it could have a more significant impact on improving participation levels.  
In some states, low-income solar programs have been structured with a single entity providing all 
aspects of program management and delivery – a vertically-integrated model.  Such a model could be 
better equipped to work with low-income customers and communities as it reduces the transaction 
costs associated with the higher need for customer education and ongoing support.  
This approach could also facilitate greater coordination with job training and placement programs, 
better incorporation of energy efficiency measures, and partnerships with local organizations. By

Section 1-56(b)(2) permits the Agency to “propose additional programs” through the Long-term 
Renewable Resources Plan, provided that the “Commission determines that the Illinois Solar for All 
Program would provide greater benefits to the public health and well-being of low-income residents 
through also supporting that additional program versus supporting programs already authorized.” 
Given the challenges faced thus far in garnering full participation in the subprograms designed for 
residential distributed generation, the Agency proposes testing a new model of program delivery for 
the ILSFA distributed generation sub-programs. 
Through a limited pilot program, the Agency would implement a more consolidated model where the 
Program Administrator will assume the majority of the customer-interaction and public outreach 
functions, such as recruiting customers (including provision of the initial program brochure), 
conducting income verification and site suitability assessment, partnering with local organizations, 
and liaising with job training and placement programs.  
The pilot will take place for two years in select, defined communities where a vendor chosen through 
a  competitive  Request  for  Proposals  process  would  serve  as  the  sole  Approved  Vendor  for 
participants.   
The pilot would be limited to distributed generation projects receiving RECs in the Low-Income 
Single Family and Small Multifamily subprogram. The Agency may establish a pre-set budget or limit 
on the number of projects.   
The Agency will conduct a stakeholder feedback process to collect input on details of the pilot design, 
such  as  the  regions  selected  for  the  pilot.    The  selected  communities  will  represent  diverse 
geographies of the state, such as one of the 77 community areas of Chicago,491 a suburban community, 
and a down-state community, and the selected communities may be an Environmental Justice 
Community  or  an  Equity  Investment  Eligible  Community  or  contain  a  concentration  of  such 
communities. The Agency will make final decisions on the pilot design and will use a request for 
proposals (“RFP”) to select an Approved Vendor for each pilot area.   
As  the  REC  price  for  the  Low-Income  Single  and  Small  Multifamily  Solar  Program  includes 
adjustments related to the increased development costs for participating projects (set at 200% of the 
comparable costs for Adjustable Block Program projects), the REC price for the pilot will be adjusted 
to recognize the lower cost to Approved Vendors that will result from the Program Administrator 
taking on many upfront responsibilities. The final REC price adjustment will also be determined 
through a stakeholder feedback process. 
The pilot will focus on preliminary customer acquisition - the selected Approved Vendor will still be 
responsible for the disclosure form and the Part I and Part II applications. However, the Program 
Administrator will continue to provide support and guidance to both the customer and the AV 
through the entire project application process.492  Each project participating in the pilot will receive

a REC delivery contract with either a utility or the Agency and must comply with all other program 
requirements and rules. 
The Pilot broadly seeks to ease the soft costs of customer acquisition for the Approved Vendor, which 
commenters have identified as a key point of difficulty thus far in the program.  
8.5.4.  Low-Income Large Multifamily Solar 
As detailed in Section 8.5.3 above, the Low-Income Large Multifamily Solar sub-program separated 
incentives for distributed generation projects serving residential facilities with five or more units, 
which were previously included in the Low-Income Distributed Generation sub-program, into a 
separate sub-program, the Low-Income Large Multifamily Solar sub-program. 
As with the Low-Income Single-Family and Small Multifamily Solar sub-program, the Low-Income 
Large Multifamily Solar projects must meet requirements of the Adjustable Block Program, as well 
as the additional low-income consumer protections outlined in Chapter 9 and Section 8.11. As with 
all Illinois Solar for All sub-programs, 25% of available funding in this sub-program will be targeted 
to environmental justice communities and 25% will be targeted to Energy Sovereignty projects that 
result in ownership by eligible customers.  
Despite being separate sub-programs, Public Act 102-0662 provided a single budget allocation to be 
shared with the new Low-Income Single and Small Family Solar sub-program.  The Agency proposes 
to allocate that funding evenly between the two sub-programs for the first nine months of the 
program year.  
If, at the end of the ninth month of the program year, there were remaining funds in the carveout, 
those would be released for projects of any size from either sub-program, and any funds of the total 
sub-program budget that remain unobligated at the end of the program year will be rolled into the 
following program year’s sub-program budget. 
8.5.4.1.  Eligibility 
To verify program eligibility for five-unit and larger residential buildings, either at least 50% of the 
tenants must be verified as low-income, or the building must be demonstrated to meet the definition 
of “affordable housing” contained in the Illinois Affordable Housing Act.493   In addition to projects 
being eligible based on household income, projects developed on homes or buildings that qualify for 
US Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) Project-Based Vouchers or Project-
Based Rental Assistance (which are programs for housing units dedicated to low-income tenants) 
also qualify.  The income qualification levels required for participation in these programs are lower 
than income requirements for the Illinois Solar for All Program. 
8.5.4.2.  Incentive Level 
As discussed in Section 7.5, these REC prices are based on an update of the REC Pricing model 
developed for this 2022. 
 
 
493 See Section 8.10.3.2 for more information on income eligibility (including a required commitment for owners of multi-family buildings).

To encourage Energy Sovereignty, an additional $10 per REC would be added for projects that result 
in ownership by the customer. 
These incentive payments are intended to be sufficient to provide tangible economic benefits to 
participants through enabling project developers to eliminate upfront costs to the participants for 
the installation of photovoltaic projects. The REC price is a standard incentive for the contractually 
obligated delivery of a renewable energy credit and not customized for each project. 
8.5.4.3.  Demonstrating Tangible Economic Benefits for Residents of 
Multi-family Buildings 
Section 1-56(b)(2) requires that the Illinois Solar for All incentives deliver tangible economic benefits 
for eligible low-income customers, including those that live in multi-family buildings.  Multi-family 
buildings can be either master metered or individually metered. For master-metered buildings, the 
economic benefits of installing a photovoltaic system will not directly impact the occupants of the 
building because they do not individually pay an electric bill to their electric utility; instead, the 
benefits accrue to the building owner/manager. For this 2022 Plan, the Agency clarifies that for 
master-metered building owners to be eligible for the Low-Income Single and Small Multifamily Solar 
and the Low-Income Large Multifamily Solar categories, the building owner/manager will need to 
commit to passing along the value of at least 50% of the energy savings from net metering to tenants 
in tangible ways: reduced (or not raised) rents; new staff that serves all tenants; facility upgrades 
(excluding  repairs  and  renovations  necessary  to  maintain  building  codes  or  organization 
certifications); new equipment that serves all tenants; or other payments, benefits, or services to all 
tenants  that  would  not  otherwise  have  been  possible  without  the  savings  generated  by  the 
photovoltaic system. These benefits must be made available to all the tenants, regardless of income 
level or individual participant uptake. Additionally, the building owner/manager will communicate 
 
494 The maximum size for projects was increased from 2M to 5 MW through Public Act 102-0662 and REC Prices have now been developed 
for this size category.

251,259,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
to all residents those benefits and how they resulted from the installation of solar. The building 
owner/manager shall demonstrate the commitment to pass along the full value of the required 
savings to residents by describing in detail how this will be accomplished.  
How the ownership benefits are managed for projects located at large multifamily buildings that 
create energy sovereignty will vary depending on the ownership model of the building. Cooperative 
housing and condominiums have an inherent ownership model for occupants, but for rental buildings 
the Agency assumes that ownership of the solar project will likely be retained by the building owner, 
and not the rental tenants. Since ownership will facilitate long-term financial benefits, the Agency 
encourages building owners to consider how benefits of ownership can be extended to tenants over 
the life of the system and will be required to present a plan to address this issue if the applicant seeks 
to qualify for an energy sovereignty adder. 
One challenge to multi-family buildings that are not master-metered is that the photovoltaic system 
will most likely be connected to the main building account that serves common areas and building-
wide load rather than to any individual unit’s account. For these buildings, the owner/manager must 
either provide the same demonstration of passing along benefits to all tenants as for master-metered 
buildings or, in the alternative, must make available to all tenants the opportunity (at no additional 
upfront cost levied by the landlord) to participate in net metering pursuant to the provisions of 
Section 16-107.5(l)(1)(B) of the PUA, which allows for net metering of “individual units, apartments, 
or properties located in a single building that are owned or leased by multiple customers and 
collectively served by a common eligible renewable electrical generating facility.”  In this instance, 
the project will utilize the interconnecting utility’s applicable net metering tariff, which will require 
the  Illinois  Solar  for  All  Approved  Vendor  to  maintain  system  shares  for  all  participating 
tenants/meters. The net metering bill credit in this instance will be supply-only and costs/savings 
will be based on this net metering value.   
8.5.5.  Low-Income Community Solar Project Initiative 
This sub-program or initiative is intended to support participation in community solar by low-
income  subscribers.  To  qualify  for  this  initiative,  community  solar  projects  must  meet  the 
requirements for community renewable generation projects outlined in the Act and beyond those 
applicable community solar projects that participate in the Adjustable Block Program. These include 
the following provisions contained in Section 1-56(b)(2)(B) of the IPA Act: 
•  [E]ach  project  shall  identify  its  partnership  with  community  stakeholders  regarding  the 
location, development, and participation in the project, provided that nothing shall preclude a 
project from including an anchor tenant that does not qualify as low-income. … 
•  It is a goal of this program that a minimum of 25% of the incentives for this program be 
allocated to community photovoltaic projects in environmental justice communities. 
•  The Agency shall reserve a portion of this program for projects that promote energy sovereignty 
through  ownership  of  projects  by  low-income  households,  not-for-profit  organizations 
providing services to low-income households, affordable housing owners, or community-based 
limited liability companies providing services to low-income households. 
For the first provision, Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors’ project applications must include a 
description of a partnership with community stakeholders in the community where the project will 
be  located  applicable  to  that  project.  While  the  Act  does  not  define  the  term  “community 
251 
 ",8. Illinois Solar for All ,[],779,20,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
252,260,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
stakeholders,”  the  National  Community–Based  Organization  Network  (NCBON) defines  a 
community-based organization as one in which: 
•  The majority of the governing body and staff consists of local residents, 
•  The main operating offices are in the community, 
•  Priority issue areas are identified and defined by residents, 
•  Solutions to address priority issues are developed with residents, and 
•  Program design, implementation, and evaluation components have residents intimately 
involved, in leadership positions.495 
The Agency will consider entities that demonstrate that they meet this definition as being able to 
represent community stakeholders in a partnership.  Furthermore, the Agency believes the intent of 
the Act was to create substantial partnerships, going beyond just holding a few community meetings. 
In addition to information regarding location, development and participation, these partnerships 
should include a description of how the partnership shows that it is responsive to the priorities and 
concerns of low-income members of the community.  
In its Initial Plan, the Agency proposed that a public entity may qualify as a community-based 
organization for this purpose, but only if the public entity meets the following requirements: 
•  The public entity must represent a municipality or county (or school district, park district, 
etc.) in a municipality or county in the bottom 25% of the state by population. 
•  The public entity must certify that no local community-based organizations exist that are 
capable of filling this role. 
•  The public entity must provide the same showing of robust community engagement as a non-
public entity would be required to show. 
•  Public  entities  that  have  failed  to  act  as  community-based  partners  in  a  past  project 
certification would be ineligible. 
 
The public entity would be qualified as a “community-based organization” only in the context of one 
project application; the qualification would not be retained for a future project application (the public 
entity would need to demonstrate the same factors again).  Finally, the public entity must provide 
ongoing reporting of its engagement approach, including public participation opportunities and 
disclosure of its approach to the project location selection (if applicable). 
 
If the proposed project has an anchor tenant that does not qualify as a low-income residential 
household, the application shall describe that anchor tenant in detail; the Illinois Solar for All 
incentive will be reduced to account for the share of the system subscribed by that tenant not 
receiving a low-income incentive. As approved in the First Revised Plan, for any anchor tenant, that 
reduction is achieved by pricing the non-low-income anchor tenant share at the equivalent applicable 
Adjustable Block Program REC price (non-profit or public anchor tenants no longer qualify for the 
higher ILSFA price).  A project may only have one anchor tenant, and that anchor tenant must be 
identified at the time of application.

Prior to the enactment of Public Act 102-0662 and the adoption of updated net metering tariffs 
resulting from that Act, community solar customers in Illinois received credit on their electricity bills 
for their community subscriptions, but received a separate bill from their community solar providers 
to pay for those subscriptions (if applicable). Program participants have reported that “dual billing” 
can  be  off-putting  to  potential  ILSFA  customers,  posing  a  significant  barrier  for  low-income 
customers considering community solar. 
However, under newly enacted Section 16-107.5(l)(4) of the Public Utilities Act,496 most community 
solar projects in Illinois can now request that a utility ""include a subscriber's subscription fee on the 
subscriber's monthly electric bill and provide the subscriber with a net credit equivalent to the total 
bill credit value for that generation period minus the subscription fee, provided the subscription fee 
is structured as a fixed percentage of bill credit value."" 
With this net crediting approach, both the cost and value of the community solar subscription will 
appear on a single utility bill, helping reduce confusion. In light of this change, the Agency will require 
future applicants to this subprogram to use single-bill net crediting.  As the law provides: 
The net crediting agreement shall set forth payment terms from the electric utility to the owner 
or operator of the community renewable generating project, and the electric utility may charge 
a net crediting fee to the owner or operator of a community renewable generating project that 
may not exceed 2% of the bill credit value.497 
This shall not apply to an electric utility serving 200,000 customers or fewer as of January 1, 2021. 
In the litigation surrounding the approval of this Plan, some parties raised concerns that the required 
use of single-bill net crediting for low-income community solar may discourage Approved Vendors 
from offering LICS projects due to a perceived higher risk of non-payment. The Agency proposed in 
its Response, and the Commission approved,498 a commitment to monitor the pace of project 
application and development in the Low-Income Community Solar sub-program. If the Agency 
witnesses a significant decline in project applications, it will request stakeholder feedback on making 
the single-bill net crediting requirement optional.  
In order to encourage projects that have deep community connections, the project selection protocol 
(see Section 8.10.2) reflects the following prioritization in project selection: 
•  Projects for which the anchor tenant is a non-profit or public facility critical service provider 
and also the project host; 
•  Projects for which the anchor tenant is a non-profit or public facility that is not a critical 
service provider and is also the project host;  
•  Projects for which the anchor tenant is a non-profit or public facility critical service provider 
but not the project host;  
•  Projects for which the anchor tenant is a non-profit or public facility that is not a critical 
service provider but not the project host;  
Projects for which the anchor tenant is not a non-profit or public facility.

To qualify for any preference in project selection for a project with an anchor tenant, the anchor 
tenant subscription must be at least 10% of the project size (and, by law, may not be more than 40%). 
For this 2022 Long-Term Plan, the Agency clarifies that for master-metered low-income residential 
housing programs to be eligible to subscribe as an anchor tenant of a Low-Income Community Solar 
project, the building owner/manager will need to commit to passing along the value of at least 50% 
of the energy savings realized from their anchor subscription to tenants in tangible ways.  Because 
the net metering bill credit in this instance will be supply-only, costs/savings will be based on this 
net metering value.  Options for methods of passing benefits to residents include: reduced (or not 
raised) rents; new staff that serves all tenants; facility upgrades (excluding repairs and renovations 
necessary to maintain building codes or organization certifications); new equipment that serves all 
tenants; or other payments, benefits, or services to all tenants that would not otherwise have been 
possible without the savings generated by the photovoltaic system. These benefits must be made 
available to all the tenants, regardless of income level or individual participant uptake. Additionally, 
the building owner/manager will communicate to all residents those benefits and how they resulted 
from the installation of solar. The building owner/manager shall demonstrate the commitment to 
pass along the full value of the required savings to residents by describing in detail how this will be 
accomplished.  
As described in Section 8.12.4, 25% of available funding in this sub-program will be targeted to 
projects in environmental justice communities. 
As specified in Section 8.5.1, community solar projects that involve energy sovereignty will be given 
a scoring preference in the application process, with a minimum of 25% of ILSFA community solar 
funding reserved for such projects. Section 8.5.1.2 describes possible ownership models for low-
income community solar projects, such as ownership in shares of a community solar cooperative and 
customer ownership of a portion of a remotely-sited community solar project. 
 
8.5.5.1.  Incentive Level 
As discussed in Section 7.5, these REC prices are based on an update of the REC Pricing model 
developed for this 2022 Plan. Note that these prices now are inclusive of the small subscriber adder

As mentioned above, the Agency will give a preference to ILSFA Low-Income Community Solar 
applications that result in energy sovereignty (ownership by eligible customers), and reserve a 
minimum of 25% of funds for such projects.  If an insufficient number of Energy Sovereignty awards 
are made to meet the 25% set-aside within nine months after the deadline for program applications, 
any remaining funds will be made available to community solar projects that do not feature energy 
sovereignty. 
Upfront costs should be limited to encourage participation by low-income customers.  
These incentives for Low-Income Community Solar Projects are for the portion of the project 
subscribed to by households who have been verified as low-income. In order to receive the incentive 
at the time of energization, the Approved Vendor will have to verify the level of low-income 
subscribers to the project as outlined Section 8.10.4.1. The Agency notes that the Adjustable Block 
Program only requires 50% of subscribers (in kW volume) to be identified at the time of energization, 
and that small subscriber adders are granted only if the project meets the small subscriber level after 
one year of operation. This principle applies to Illinois Solar for All’s Low-Income Community Solar 
Project Initiative as well. Only 50% of the low-income subscribers will need to be identified by the 
time the project is energized to receive payment under the REC delivery contract; however, the total 
amount of that incentive payment will be prorated to the anchor and low-income subscription levels 
at the time of energization. After one year, a payment adjustment shall potentially be made based 
upon the anchor and low-income subscription level achieved by that time.  
To ensure ongoing subscription levels by low-income subscribers, the Approved Vendor will have to 
provide ongoing collateral for ten years equal to 5% of the remaining REC value and report annually

on low-income subscription levels. If those levels are not maintained, then the collateral may be 
called upon to claw back the incentives to the level of low-income subscription.  
8.5.6.  Incentives for Non-Profits and Public Facilities 
Section 1-56(b)(2)(C) of the Act specifies that “non-profits and public facilities” are eligible to receive 
incentives for on-site photovoltaic generation.  These incentives are designed to “support on-site 
photovoltaic distributed renewable energy generation devices to serve the load associated with not-
for-profit customers and to support photovoltaic distributed renewable energy generation that uses 
photovoltaic technology to serve the load associated with public sector customers taking service at 
public buildings.”502 The Act does not provide what specific non-profit organizations or public sector 
customers may be eligible.  
8.5.6.1.  Eligibility 
Given that the objective of the Illinois Solar for All Program is in part “to bring photovoltaics to low-
income communities,”503 it is reasonable to infer that only non-profits and public sector customers 
that in some manner serve low-income communities should be eligible. However, the Act could also 
be interpreted such that all non-profits and public facilities would be eligible to participate.  Because 
current funding levels are such that only a few large projects might make up the whole of the Non-
Profit/Public Facilities budget in a single program year, focusing available funds on low-income and 
environmental justice communities to align with the legislative objectives has been the Agency’s 
approach. 
To balance these objectives, initially Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors will have to demonstrate 
that the project:  
1.  Meets the standards described in Section 8.9 related to projects having sufficient connection 
to, and input from, low-income community members; 
2.  Is sited within an environmental justice community504 or low-income community;505  
3.  Serves the electricity load of a building that is occupied by an organization that is a critical 
service provider for the community506 (e.g., youth centers, hospitals, homeless shelters, 
senior centers, community centers, places of worship); if a public facility, the building must 
host a department/agency that is a critical service provider meeting this standard; and 
4.  The Approved Vendor must either certify that the project’s owner will not apply for the 
federal Investment Tax Credit in relation to the project installation, or if it will apply for the 
Investment Tax Credit, then the savings level for the participating host of the project must be 
65% of energy value rather than 50%.  
As described in Section 8.12.4, 25% of available funding in this sub-program will be targeted to 
environmental justice communities, and 25% will be targeted for energy sovereignty projects that 
result in ownership by eligible customers.

New language in Section 1-75 established a category in the Adjustable Block Program specifically to 
serve public schools.  Considering the creation of that new Adjustable Block Program category as well 
as the ongoing high interest in the subprogram that has exceeded available funding, the Agency will 
not include public schools in the Non-Profit/Public Facilities sub-program after the 2022-2023 
program year. The Agency will allow participation for the 2022-2023 program year in recognition 
that there may be projects already under development that are using the financing assumptions of 
the Illinois Solar for All program (e.g., payments upon energization) rather than the 20-year pay-as-
RECs-are-delivered model that is included in the Adjustable Block Program.  Similarly, Public Act 
102-0662 also created a specific sub-program to serve multifamily residential distributed generation 
projects. The Agency will also no longer allow distributed generation projects serving multifamily 
residential facilities to participate in the Non-profit/Public Facilities sub-program since these types 
of projects qualify to apply for the Low-Income Large Multifamily Solar sub-program. The Agency 
also notes that the REC Prices proposed in this 2022 Plan are higher in the Low-Income Large 
Multifamily Solar sub-program than in the Non-Profit and Public Facility sub-program so this change 
is likely to have minimal impact. 
The Agency will otherwise maintain its current definition of a Critical Service Provider as a non-profit 
or public entity that offers critical services to low-income or environmental communities.  A list of 
accepted service provider types will continue to be maintained in the ILSFA Approved Vendor 
Manual, and requests for consideration by entities not on that list will be reviewed by the Agency on 
a case-by-case basis. 
8.5.6.2.  Incentive Level 
As discussed in Section 7.5, these REC prices are based on the updated REC Pricing model as 
approved by the ICC in its Final Order dated July 14, 2022.

As with Community Solar, the Agency will give preference to applications for Non-Profits and Public 
Facilities that result in energy sovereignty (ownership by eligible customers), and will reserve a 
minimum of 25% of funds for such projects.  If the number of Energy Sovereignty awards do not meet 
the 25% set-aside within nine months after the deadline for program applications, any remaining 
funds will be made available to non-profit and public facility projects that do not feature energy 
sovereignty. 
8.5.7.  Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Projects 
Public Act 99-0906 established a sub-program for Low-Income Community Solar (“LICS”) Pilot 
Projects, to test approaches to serving eligible customers. The law specified that projects must 
provide economic benefits for members of the community where the project is located and include a 
partnership with at least one Community Based Organization.  
The LICS Pilot procurement process was conducted by the Agency’s Procurement Administrator, who 
handled the intake and evaluation of all project proposals, and made recommendations for bid 
approval to the ICC. Two pilot projects were awarded REC contracts totaling $20 million in the fall of 
2019, with an average REC price of $72.02. As of March 2022, the projects had not been fully 
subscribed.  
Public Act 102-0662 removed the Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Procurement sub-program 
from Section 1-56 of the IPA, so no further procurement will be conducted.   
8.6. Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator 
The Program Administrator for the Illinois Solar for All Program was selected via a two-part Request 
for Qualifications/Request for Proposals process conducted by the Agency in 2018, which culminated 
in  Commission  approval  of  the  contract  for  Elevate  Energy  to  serve  as  the  ILSFA  Program 
Administrator on September 14, 2018 for a period of two years, with the option for annual renewal 
for up to three additional years.  Revisions to 1-56(b)(2)(5) of the IPA Act clarify that the Illinois Solar 
for All Program Administrator “may be, but need not be, the same administrator as for the Adjustable 
Block Program.”  The Agency issued a new Request for Qualifications on August 8, 2022, and expects 
to issue a Request for Proposals in late 2022. 
The obligations of the Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator expanded under revisions to 
Section 1-56(b)(5) by Public Act 102-0662, which now include at minimum:  
•  Take applications and verify project eligibility in Illinois Solar for All and coordinate this 
information with the Adjustable Block Program Administrator (who will process the actual 
generation of contracts). This includes, but is not limited to, review of project technical 
specifications, income verification, review of community involvement in projects, review of 
job training coordination, and review of Illinois Solar for All consumer protections such as 
verification of ensuring tangible economic benefits flow to low-income participants. Illinois 
Solar for All administrative procedures will be as similar to those of the Adjustable Block 
Program as possible, to reduce administrative burden on Approved Vendors that serve both 
programs.

•  Act as the centralized source for income verification and maintain database of program 
participants. 
 
•  Assist in the development of contracts, disclosure forms, and brochures for use by Illinois 
Solar for All Approved Vendors and their partner community-based organizations.  
 
•  Coordinate the distribution of funding for grassroots education efforts by community-based 
organizations.  A priority for this funding will be to promote the availability of the Illinois 
Solar for All Program in Environmental Justice Communities to achieve the goal of 25% of the 
incentives being allocated to those communities. 
 
•  Facilitate Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors meeting the additional requirements of the 
Illinois Solar for All Program. In particular, the Program Administrator acts as a liaison 
between  Illinois  Solar  for  All  Approved  Vendors  participating  in  the  programs  and 
organizations providing job training. The Program Administrator will also work to inform 
Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors of energy efficiency, weatherization, lead abatement, 
and other program opportunities that could provide additional benefits to participants. 
 
•  Provide guidance and education to Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors, community 
groups, local government agencies, and others on how to leverage other governmental 
policies to facilitate low-income solar projects and energy efficiency programs.  Other 
relevant policies include affordable housing, economic development, public finance, and tax 
policies, at the federal, state, and local level. The Administrator will act as liaison with other 
governmental  agencies  that  administer  such  programs  to  facilitate  their  use  on  solar 
development. 
 
•  Provide Program Manual and related materials for use by Illinois Solar for All Approved 
Vendors.  
 
•  Provide reports to the Agency and the Commission on a quarterly basis on the status of the 
Program  including,  but  not  limited  to,  number  of  applications  received,  number  of 
applications approved, number of projects completed, REC payments, payments for and 
status of grassroots education efforts (if applicable), and a summary of technical assistance 
provided.  
 
•  Facilitate “placement for graduates of Illinois-based renewable energy-specific job training 
programs, including the Clean Jobs Workforce Network Program and the Illinois Climate 
Works  Preapprenticeship  Program administered  by  the  Department of Commerce  and 
Economic Opportunity, along with other programs administered under Section 16-108.12 of

qualified  energy  efficiency  programs,  including  customer  referrals  to  and  from  such 
programs,  and  connecting  prospective  low-income  solar  customers  with  any  existing 
deferred maintenance programs where applicable.”510 
8.7. Quality Assurance 
Due to the higher incentive level that Illinois Solar for All projects will receive compared to those that 
participate in the Adjustable Block Program, as well as the additional vulnerabilities that program 
participants may face, it is especially important for the Agency to ensure that projects are properly 
installed and produce their expected amounts of energy. In conjunction with the Program Evaluator 
(as described in Section 8.14), the Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator has developed and 
implemented a process for quality assurance, including assessing 1) the suitability of sites for solar 
installation and/or the proper planning for mitigating site deficiencies before installation, 2) a 
thorough photo documentation of all projects while under construction, and 3) on-site inspection of 
a random sample of installations. If installations are found to have deficiencies or nonconformance 
with specifications from the application, the Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor, at its own 
expense, will be responsible for any repairs, alterations, or additions to remedy the deficiencies. A 
deficient project may be removed from the Program if already contracted. Illinois Solar for All 
Approved Vendors who have a disproportionately high number of deficient systems may lose their 
eligibility to continue to participate in the Illinois Solar for All Program. The Agency continues to 
work with the Program Administrator to streamline these quality assurance processes.  
8.8. Coordination with Other Programs 
Public Act 102-0662 requires that Illinois Solar for All “be implemented in a manner that seeks to 
minimize  administrative  costs  and  maximize  efficiencies  and  synergies  available  through 
coordination with similar initiatives, including the Adjustable Block Program..., energy efficiency 
programs, job training programs, and community action agencies.""511 
It creates a number of new programs that interact with Illinois Solar for All, as described below. 
8.8.1.  Job Training and Placement Programs 
Public Act 102-0662 expanded on the job training and placement programs initiated under Public 
Act 99-0906. Those programs now include the Clean Jobs Workforce Network Program, the Illinois 
Climate Works Pre-apprenticeship Program, Returning Residents Clean Jobs Program, Clean Energy 
Contractor Incubator Program, Clean Energy Primes Contractor Accelerator Program, and the Energy 
Transition Barrier Reduction Program. It creates three Regional Administrators (North, Central, and 
South) to administer the implementation of the programs.

While these programs are to be designed and implemented under the guidance of DCEO, they have a 
number of implications for the Illinois Solar for All program, as the source of trainees required for 
program job training requirements, as detailed in Section 8.9.1.  
Section 1-56(b)(2) of the Act contains two provisions that are designed to ensure that the job trainees 
supported by the job training programs participate in the installation of photovoltaic projects 
supported by the program. The first of these requirements is aspirational in nature, while the second 
is more specific. 
The first provision is that “[p]rojects must include job training opportunities if available, with the 
specific level of trainee usage to be determined through the Agency’s long-term renewable resources 
procurement plan, and the Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator shall coordinate with the job 
training programs described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section 16-108.12 of the Public 
Utilities Act and in the Energy Transition Act.”512 This program is known as the “solar training 
pipeline program.”  The job training program is to be “designed to ensure that entities that offer 
training are located in, and trainees are recruited from, the same communities that the program aims 
to  serve  and  that  the  program  provides  trainees  with  the  opportunity  to  obtain  real-world 
experience.”513 
Prior to Public Act 102-0662, Section 1-75(c)(1)(O) authorized $10,000,000 of ComEd’s RPS Budget 
to be allocated to fund solar job training programs pursuant to Section 16-108.12 of the PUA every 
four  years,  beginning  with  the  2017-2018  delivery  year.    P.A.  102-0662  revised  Section  1-
75(c)(1)(O), now requiring that “[f]or the delivery years beginning June 1, 2021, June 1, 2024, June 
1, 2027, and June 1, 2030” – every three years– “$10,000,000 shall be provided to the Department of 
Commerce and Economic Opportunity to implement the workforce development programs and 
reporting as outlined in Section 16-108.12 of the Public Utilities Act.” (Emphasis added.)  However, 
Section 16-108.12 of the Public Utilities Act still directs the utilities to spend $3,000,000 in each of 
2021, and 2025 to train installers for the solar projects authorized and contemplated under the 
Illinois Solar for All program and other RPS programs.514  
On December 13, 2021, ComEd petitioned the Commission to reopen Docket No. 17-0332, seeking 
for its prior-approved workforce development plan to be “modified to address (i) DCEO’s new role 
as the implementer of the Section 16-108.12 workforce development programs (and termination of 
ComEd’s implementer role), (ii) ComEd’s remittance of funding to DCEO for the applicable delivery 
year, and (iii) any administrative activities that ComEd will continue to perform in support of the 
workforce development programs now implemented by DCEO.”  That petition to reopen was 
unanimously granted by the Commission on December 16, 2021.  On March 3, 2022, the Illinois 
Commerce  Commission  approved  the  joint  proposed  order  filed  by  ComEd  and  DCEO  which 
stipulates that ComEd will continue funding the Craft Apprenticeship Program and the Multi-Cultural 
Jobs Program through the end of the defined Transition Period, and that DCEO will issue a new RFP 
for the Solar Training Pipeline Program.515

The availability of job training opportunities for Illinois Solar for All projects depends, in part, on the 
availability of graduates of the solar training pipeline program.   As of the filing of this final 2022 
Long-Term Plan, DCEO has awarded grants to five providers of the Solar Training Pipeline program. 
DCEO expects to issue contract awards for the Multi-Cultural Jobs Program in early fall of 2022.  
Second, as added to Section 1-56(b)(2) by Public Act 102-0662, all Illinois Solar for All sub-program 
descriptions direct that “[c]ompanies participating in this program that install solar panels shall 
commit to hiring job trainees for a portion of their low-income installations” and further that, “an 
administrator shall facilitate partnering the companies that install solar panels with entities that 
provide solar panel installation job training.”516  
ComEd stated in the ICC proceeding reviewing its Section 16-108.12 job training plan that it intends 
to  implement  the  Solar  Craft  Apprenticeship  Program  in  coordination  with  the  International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) Local 134, which will integrate solar training curricula 
into its existing electrical craft/trade/skill apprenticeship programs at 18 IBEW sites as well as 
certain community colleges and high schools.517  According to the Plan submitted by ComEd in that 
proceeding, the Solar Craft Apprenticeship Program appears to include training locations located 
across the entire State, and not just in ComEd’s service territory.518 This program may be essential 
for ensuring the availability of job trainees across the State.  ComEd has released a report detailing 
the status of its job training programs under Section 16-108.12 annually since 2019.519  Beginning 
July 1, 2022, ComEd has ceased all funding and oversight of these workforce training programs. DCEO 
has awarded the Solar Craft Apprenticeship Program contract to IBEW, and the Agency will continue 
to coordinate with DCEO to ensure alignment with the implementation of these programs and Illinois 
Solar for All.  
In 1-56(b)(5), Public Act 102-0662 further instructs that, “To increase the update of trainees by 
participating firms, the administrator shall also develop a web-based clearinghouse for information 
available to both job training program graduates and firms participating, directly or indirectly, in 
Illinois solar incentive programs.” The Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator is coordinating 
with the entities providing job training to maintain a clearinghouse of information that Illinois Solar 
for All Approved Vendors can use to identify potential job training program graduates to hire.  ComEd 
administers a FEJA Jobs portal (https://fejajobs.vouchedin.com/) where graduates of its job training 
programs created under Section 16-108.12 of the Public Utilities Act can post their resumes and 
employers can post opportunities for jobs and specific projects.  The Program Administrator has 
provided training to Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors on how to access and use this portal, and 
will continue to work with the organizations receiving statutorily-authorizing funding to provide job 
training in an ongoing effort aimed at encouraging participation in the FEJA Jobs portal by those 
programs’ graduates.   
The Agency and its Program Administrator(s) do not run the job training programs, and therefore, 
the Agency has limited ability to ensure the success of those programs in effectively training new 
 
516 20 ILCS 3855/1-56(b)(2)(A), (B), (C) and (E).

employment opportunities for those new workers, and will track and report data on job placement. 
8.8.2.  Equity and Environmental Justice programs 
In  Section  5-60  of  the  Energy  Transition  Act,  Public  Act  102-0662  establishes  the  Jobs  and 
Environmental Justice Grant Program with two subprograms: the Equitable Energy Future Grant 
Program and the Community Solar Energy Sovereignty Grant Program, administered by the DCEO. 
The grant programs will make grant awards of up to $1,000,000 per application “to provide 
businesses, organizations, and community groups with capital needed to plan, develop, and execute"" 
a renewable energy or energy efficiency project. 
The Jobs and Environmental Justice Grant Program will “coordinate with and supplement existing 
incentive programs, such as the Adjustable Block program, the Illinois Solar for All Program, the 
community renewable generation projects, and renewable energy procurements as described in the 
Illinois Power Agency Act, as well as utility energy efficiency measures as described in Section 8-
103B of the Public Utilities Act.""520  The Equitable Energy Future Grant Program is specifically for 
“equity eligible contractors"" while the Community Solar Energy Sovereignty Grant Program will 
support  “the  pre-development  and  development  of  community  solar  projects  that  promote 
community  ownership  and  energy  sovereignty.""  The  Agency  will  work  with  DCEO  to  ensure 
coordination in the implementation of these programs and the Illinois Solar for All Program. 
Finally, Public Act 102-0662 enacted the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund Act, which establishes 
the Illinois Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund, discussed below in conjunction with the Climate Bank. 
8.8.3.  Energy Efficiency Programs and Community Action Agencies 
Section 1-56(b)(2) of the Act provides that the Illinois Solar for All Program ""shall be implemented 
in a manner that seeks to minimize administrative costs, and maximize efficiencies and synergies 
available through coordination with similar initiatives"" including energy efficiency programs and 
community  action  agencies  (“CAAs”).  There  are  35  CAAs  in  Illinois  that  administer  state 
weatherization and energy assistance programs.  
Public Act 102-0662 amended Section 8-103B(c) of the Public Utilities Act to direct utilities “to 
bundle  low-income  energy  efficiency  offerings  with  other  programs  that  serve  low-income 
households to maximize the benefits going to these households. The utilities shall market and 
implement low-income energy efficiency programs in coordination with low-income assistance 
programs, the Illinois Solar for All Program, and weatherization whenever practicable.""   
Section 1-56(b)(8) of the IPA Act, as amended by Public Act 102-0662, instructs: 
As  part  of  the  development  and  update  of  the  long-term  renewable  resources 
procurement plan authorized by subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act, the Agency 
shall plan for: (A) actions to refer customers from the Illinois Solar for All Program to 
electric and natural gas income-qualified energy efficiency programs, and vice versa, 
with the goal of increasing participation in both of these programs; (B) effective 
procedures for data sharing, as needed, to effectuate referrals between the Illinois Solar 
for All Program and both electric and natural gas income-qualified energy efficiency

programs, including sharing customer information directly with the utilities, as needed 
and  appropriate;  and  (C)  efforts  to  identify  any  existing  deferred  maintenance 
programs for which prospective Solar for All Program customers may be eligible and 
connect prospective customers for whom deferred maintenance is or may be a barrier 
to solar installation to those programs. 
The Program Administrator has identified energy efficiency programs and programs to address 
deferred maintenance and maintains current information about these resources in Resource Guides 
to assist potential Illinois Solar for All Program participants in overcoming barriers to participation.  
The Agency and the Program Administrator will work with utilities, administrators of the Low 
Income  Home  Energy  Assistance  Program  (“LIHEAP”)  and  the  Illinois  Home  Weatherization 
Assistance Program (“IHWAP”), and other relevant organizations to develop opportunities to share 
referrals between ILSFA and programs that similarly address energy costs and energy burdens of 
low-income households and non-profit and public facility participants. 
As detailed further in Section 8.15, and as approved by the ICC in its Final Order of July 14, 2022 in 
Docket No. 22-0231, the Agency interprets updated language in Section 1-56(b)(3) expanding use of 
“other activities deemed to be qualified by the Agency” to allow support for activities driving ILSFA 
participation beyond education, and will explore ways it can further support ILSFA outreach 
activities.  
8.8.4.  Climate Bank and the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund 
Public Act 102-0662 establishes financial vehicles to aid in the deployment of clean energy.  Article 
850 of the Illinois Finance Authority Act as enacted by Public Act 102-0662 directs the Illinois Finance 
Authority to create a Climate Bank “to aid in all respects with providing financial assistance, 
programs, and products to finance and otherwise develop and facilitate opportunities to develop 
clean energy and provide clean water, drinking water, and wastewater treatment in the State.""521  
While the Climate Bank has not been launched yet, green banks in other states have played an active 
role in financing distributed solar.  The Connecticut Green Bank, for example, provides a production-
based  incentive  of  8.1¢  per  kWh  for  low-income  customers  plus  below  market-rate  debt  to 
developers  to  facilitate  lower  pricing  and  encourage  the  participation  of  market-rate  capital 
providers. 
Section 20-15 of the Illinois Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund Act enacted through P.A. 102-0662 
creates the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund, a nonprofit corporation. The Fund ""has authority to 
pursue a broad range of financial products and services""522 that ""foster the development and 
commercialization of clean energy projects, including projects serving low-income, environmental 
justice, and BIPOC communities, and support project development by MBE and other contractors of 
color.""523 The board of the Fund will be appointed by the governor, and Section 20-30(a) of the Illinois 
Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund Act directs the board of the Fund to consider a number of 
investment initiatives, many of which could affect ILSFA, including “a solar lease, power-purchase 
agreement, or loan-to-own product specifically designed to complement and grow the Illinois Solar

for All Program.”  The Agency will work with the Program Administrator and the board of the Clean 
Energy Jobs and Justice Fund to facilitate integration across the programs. 
Neither Sections 850-5 of the Illinois Finance Authority Act nor Section 20-20 of the Illinois Clean 
Energy Jobs and Justice Fund Act within Public Act 102-0662 prohibits solar developers and other 
commercial stakeholders to participate as board members on these bodies, which could create the 
potential for a financial conflict of interest if solar developers participating in Illinois Solar for All are 
board members of these new entities. The Agency requested stakeholder feedback in November 
2021  to  explore  if  additional  protections  are  needed  to  prevent  gaming  or  undue  influence.   
Stakeholders commented, and the Agency concurs, that policies to prevent conflict of interest should 
be put in place at the two organizations, with disclosure to the Agency and Program Administrator if 
those companies participate in Solar For All programs. 
8.8.5.  Equitable Energy Upgrade Program 
Section16-111.10 of the Public Utilities Act as enacted by Public Act 102-0662 directs the Illinois 
Commerce  Commission  to  establish  the  Equitable  Energy  Upgrade  Program,  which  “permits 
customers to finance the construction of energy projects through an optional tariff payable directly 
through their utility bill, modeled after the Pay As You Save system, developed by the Energy 
Efficiency Institute.”524 Funds may be used for solar installations and other energy improvements. 
The program “shall enable utilities to offer to make investments”525 or arrange financing from third 
parties or from the Illinois Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund, established through the Illinois Clean 
Energy Jobs and Justice Fund within Public Act 102-0662.  The program guidelines should follow the 
“Pay As You Save Essential Elements and Minimum Program Requirements,”526 which requires a 
minimum of 20% savings, consumer protections, and other measures. Pay As You Save (“PAYS”) can 
be a way to finance ownership of on-site solar, especially for residents of small 1-4 unit buildings, 
since repayment is encumbered to the meter, and passes on to any future occupant living in that unit. 
While PAYS can work with customers of any income level, there may be synergies to applying it to 
customers eligible for the Solar For All program as a way to encourage energy sovereignty. 
The Agency looks forward to collaborating with the Commission on ways to integrate the Equitable 
Energy Upgrade Program with Illinois Solar for All. 
8.8.6.  Coordination with programs that support building repairs and 
upgrades 
ILSFA program participants have reported that some eligible households have been prevented from 
participating in the program due to repairs or upgrades needed on their home or building before 
solar can be installed. 
While the Agency proposes a new pilot program in Section 8.5.3.3 to address costs related to 
necessary upgrades to the premises for hosting a solar project, the Agency notes that there are 
various other state, federal, and non-profit programs that provide home repairs and upgrades for 
eligible households.

The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers such programs, and cites a 
number of other agencies and non-profits that provide a range of assistance, including  HUD-
approved housing counseling agencies, the Illinois Housing Development Authority, Illinois affiliates 
of Habitat for Humanity, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Loan Centers, and the USDA 
Rural Development Office.527 
The Agency and the ILSFA Program Administrator will reach out to these entities and explore the 
potential for coordination between solar installations and home repair programs, and seek to 
integrate those opportunities into the ILSFA program. 
8.9. Additional Requirements for Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors 
Because the Illinois Solar for All Program (other than the Low-income Community Solar Pilot 
Projects) works similarly to the Adjustable Block Program, direct participants must first be approved 
as Adjustable Block Program Approved Vendors through the process outlined in Section 7.7.2. 
Approved Vendors who seek to submit projects into Illinois Solar for All will additionally have to 
register with the Illinois Solar for All Program and agree to additional terms and conditions to 
become an Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor.528 An Approved Vendor that does not achieve this 
status will not be eligible to submit projects. A list of Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors is 
available on both the Adjustable Block Program website and Illinois Solar for All website. 
The additional requirements for registering to be an Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor include: 
•  Description of plans for community involvement in projects (where applicable) 
•  Plan for inclusion of job training opportunities 
•  A commitment to hire job trainees for a portion of the projects as described in Section 8.9.1  
•  Coordination with the Program Administrator on income verification 
•  Agreement to allow the Program Administrator and Agency to review and approve marketing 
materials geared towards the Illinois Solar for All Program 
•  Agreement to ensure additional consumer protections as described in Section 8.11 
•  Demonstration for low-income distributed generation and community solar projects that 
participants do not have any up-front payments. 
The Agency recognizes the importance of equity and minority-/women-owned business enterprise 
(“MWBE”) participation in the Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor cohort and will continue to work 
with the Program Administrator to expand MWBE Approved Vendor participation, including direct 
outreach to potential MWBE Approved Vendors, as well as partnering with and outreach to equity-
focused industry groups. 
Section 1-56(b)(2) of the IPA Act provides that “[p]riority shall be given to projects that demonstrate 
meaningful involvement of low-income community members in designing the initial proposals” and 
that “[a]cceptable proposals to implement projects must demonstrate the applicant's ability to 
conduct initial community outreach, education, and recruitment of low-income participants in the 
 
527 US Department of Housing and Urban Development, Home Repairs: Illinois, accessed March 2022. 
528 This includes the option to be an Illinois Solar for All Single Project Approved Vendor similar to the Adjustable Block Program Single 
Project Approved Vendor option. The minimum project size would be 50 kW.

community.”529 For community solar projects, applicants must identify partnerships with community 
stakeholders.  It is less clear how those provisions would apply directly to projects that participate 
in either the Low-Income Distributed Generation Incentive sub-program or the Incentives for Non-
profits and Public Facilities sub-program.  
To satisfy these provisions, the registration process for the Illinois Solar for All Program will require 
Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors to demonstrate their capacities in this area. An Illinois Solar 
for All Approved Vendor will do so by satisfying all of the following requirements: 
•  Providing narrative summary of efforts taken prior to the application to conduct community 
outreach, education, and recruitment 
•  Listing community-based organizations the applicant has partnered with, including letters 
from those organizations to verify the partnerships 
•  Describing in detail ongoing plans for community outreach, education, and recruitment 
•  Describing staffing for dedicated outreach, education, and recruitment 
•  Describing plans for ensuring that tangible economic benefits flow to program participants 
•  Participating in training offered by the Program Administrator on guidelines for marketing, 
contracting, and standard disclosures for program participants  
Failure to maintain a demonstrated commitment to these requirements may result in an Illinois Solar 
for All Approved Vendor being removed from participating in the Illinois Solar for All Program. 
8.9.1.  Job Training Requirements 
As described in Section 8.8.1, Section 1-56(b)(2) of the Act contains two provisions that are designed 
to ensure that the job trainees supported by the job training programs participate in the installation 
of photovoltaic projects supported by the program. Section 8.8.1 addresses the first provision’s 
instruction to coordinate with job training programs, while this section addresses the second 
provision specifying that “[c]ompanies participating in this program that install solar panels shall 
commit to hiring job trainees for a portion of their low-income installations.”530 
The Act does not specify what is meant by “a portion” and also does not define who would qualify as 
a “job trainee,” The Agency allows for other solar training programs in Illinois to be proposed to the 
Program Administrator for consideration as an Other Qualifying Program, as described in 8.8.1. For 
the purposes of defining “job trainees, the Agency will consider graduates of both the training 
programs created by Section 16-108.12 of the Public Utilities Act as well as designated Other 
Qualifying Programs to be considered “job trainees” for the purposes of Illinois Solar for All job 
trainee employment requirements, and will be given equal consideration.   
To ensure that “a portion” of projects use job trainees, Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors who 
participate will have to demonstrate that at least 33% of projects (on a rolling average basis) include 
the use of one or more job trainees from the solar training pipeline program, the craft apprenticeship 
program,  the  multi-cultural  jobs  program,  or  training  program  designated  by  the  Program 
Administrator as an Other Qualifying Program.531  Furthermore, each Illinois Solar for All Approved

Vendor will have to demonstrate that for its first year of participation, 10% of the hours worked on 
all projects will be by job trainees, and that amount would increase to 20% in their second year of 
participation, and 33% in the third year. The timeline for these increasing annual percentage 
requirements will start with the beginning of construction of the Approved Vendor’s first project 
contracted under the Program.  
Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors are required to document the use of job trainees by providing 
a summary of job trainee work to the Program Administrator; the Program Administrator will track 
and report progress on job placements. Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors may also request to 
use job trainees from other job training programs so long as the Approved Vendor can demonstrate 
that completion of the job training program would lead to the trainee becoming a “Qualified Person” 
under the Part 468 Rule related to the certification of installers of photovoltaic systems (see Section 
2.6.2.4 for additional discussion of these requirements). The Agency will consider requests for 
waivers of this requirement on a case-by-case basis if an Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor can 
demonstrate that, despite diligent efforts at recruitment, job trainees are not available in the area 
where projects are being installed and this would prevent the project from being completed. 
8.10.  Application Process 
8.10.1.  Project Submissions and Batches 
Except for Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Projects, the process for a project to be submitted to 
the Illinois Solar for All Program generally mirrors that for the Adjustable Block Program described 
in Section 7.10. Projects are submitted by Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors through a similar 
process as the Adjustable Block Program, but to expedite processing of ILSFA projects there is no 
minimum batch size.532 There is no application fee for Illinois Solar for All projects. 
Applications will be submitted through the Illinois Solar for All project application portal and will 
provide the supplemental information required for Illinois Solar for All beyond that required for an 
Adjustable Block Program project.533  If the supplemental information does not demonstrate that the 
project qualifies for participation in the Illinois Solar for All Program, the project may still be eligible 
to participate in the Adjustable Block Program through a separate application (including the payment 
of an application fee), although any such application would be subject to the availability of block 
capacity in the Adjustable Block Program. A project may not apply to the Illinois Solar for All Program 
if it is included in a batch of Adjustable Block Program projects that have been submitted to the 
Commission for approval (or subsequently approved). If a project applies to both programs, the 
Illinois Solar for All application will have to be withdrawn at the time the Adjustable Block Program 
sends its approval recommendation to the Commission (and vice versa).  Additionally, a project may 
not apply to two sub-programs of Illinois Solar for All within the same program year. 
Like for the Adjustable Block Program, Illinois Solar for All projects will be bundled into one contract 
or confirmation for each approved batch. The Agency will request Commission approval for contracts 
that include additional Illinois Solar for All provisions. Under this Plan, those contracts will be 
executed first with the utilities using the allocation from their Renewable Resources Budgets, and 
 
532 In prior Plans the Agency had required a 50 kW minimum batch size but is removing that requirement from the 2022 Long-Term Plan 
to help encourage participation by small and emerging businesses.  
533 A number of program participants have reported difficulty using the ILSFA portal. The Program Administrators of the two programs 
will work together to make their portals and processes as simple and uniform as possible. 
268 
 ",8. Illinois Solar for All ,[],746,25,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
269,277,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
then by the Agency using funds from the Renewable Energy Resources Fund.  For contracts allocated 
to a utility, the Program Administrator will strive to allocate contracts to each utility for projects in 
their service territory, and in a manner that will obligate funds at a level consistent with each utility’s 
share of funds committed to Illinois Solar for All. 
Like the Adjustable Block Program contract process described in Section 6.10.6, an Approved 
Vendor’s failure to timely execute a product order will potentially subject that Approved Vendor to 
discipline, and the constituent projects will be considered removed from the Illinois Solar for All 
Program.  Additionally, as discussed in Section 7.11.1 for the ABP, when an Approved Vendor’s 
collateral is forfeited under its ILSFA REC contract (if the contract is with a utility), that collateral 
amount will be restored to the utility’s Renewable Resources Budget, and if the contract is with the 
Agency, that collateral amount would be deposited into the Renewable Energy Resources Fund. 
The process for posting collateral will mirror that for the Adjustable Block Program described in 
Sections 7.12.2.  For a Low-Income Community Solar project that is not yet energized at the time of 
Commission approval, the contract value (for purposes of calculating the required collateral posting) 
will be based on an assumption that 100% of the project is subscribed by low-income residential 
households qualifying as “small subscribers.” 
8.10.2.  Project Selection for Sub-programs with High Demand 
Projects for each sub-program must initially be submitted within pre-determined project submission 
windows for each program year. In the case that a sub-program has a large number of applications 
such that the funding required for all eligible applications received within the submission window 
exceeds that sub-program’s total budget (including RERF funds and utility funds)534 for that program 
year, the Agency will establish a protocol that provides a basis for scoring each individual project 
based on attributes that align with the goals of this 2022 Plan and creates a ranking of projects based 
on these scores.535 The highest scoring projects will be selected for funding first, where possible, 
ensuring funds prioritize projects that directly meet Plan objectives. One objective of this selection 
protocol will be to minimize the use of random tie-breaking as a means of selection. 
Attributes that will receive higher scores include: 
•  Location with an Environmental Justice Community; 
•  Location within a low-income community (as defined above in Section 0); 
•  Projects developed by Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors that are women- or minority-
owned businesses, or small and emerging businesses; 
•  Preferences for types of subscribers in Low-Income Community Solar projects, as outlined in 
Section 8.5.5; 
•  Preferences for projects that result in ownership by eligible customers or subscribers, as 
described in the discussion of Energy Sovereignty in Sections 8.2.4 and 8.5.1; or 
•  Other attributes that align with Plan priorities. 
 
534 Note that sub-program budgets are adjusted to account for any funds not committed in the previous program year and rolled over, 
administrative expenses, and grassroots education costs. Furthermore, the Agency may adjust allocations of utility-supplied funding if 
needed.  
535  This  approach  has  been  utilized  for  the  2018-2019  and  2019-2020  program  years.  See: 
https://www.illinoissfa.com/app/uploads/2019/05/ILSFA-Project-Selection-Protocol.pdf. The Agency expects that an update to the 
protocol will include additional granularity in scoring to minimize the likelihood of tied scores that would require random selection of 
projects. 
269 
 ",8. Illinois Solar for All ,[],726,18,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
270,278,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
In addition, scoring will be weighted in such a way that helps to ensure a diversity of project 
development compared with all projects submitted for a given sub-program. For example, additional 
weighting might be given for: 
•  Geographic location, 
•  Project size, or 
•  Other such attributes that reflect a diversity of projects. 
The project selection protocol should be executed in a way that ensures that 25% of funds go to 
projects  located  in  Environmental  Justice  communities  or  to  projects  that  encourage  Energy 
Sovereignty whenever possible.  As discussed in Section 8.12.4 below, the 25% allocation for projects 
located in Environmental Justice communities and for projects that encourage Energy Sovereignty 
within each sub-program will be held open until the end of each program year. 
After each program year’s initial project submission window, if funds for a given sub-program remain 
available, project applications will be accepted and reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis for 
the remainder of the program year.  If annually allocated RERF funds in a sub-program remain at the 
end of the program year, the unused funds will be rolled over to the next program year for that sub-
program.  Additionally, if funds become available due to the withdrawal of any projects during a 
program year and after project selection, those funds may be made available to the next eligible 
project on the waitlist for that program year. The waitlist from each program year will not carry over 
to the following program year.   
If the Part II project approval (e.g., energization verification) results in the final REC contracts value 
being revised downward, the funds made available from that revision would be made available 
within the applicable sub-programs for consideration by any projects remaining in the waitlist queue 
for the current program year. The next eligible project on the general waitlist for that sub-program 
would be awarded those funds or given an option to resize the project in proportion to the newly 
available funds in a similar fashion to the last projects selected during the project selection process.   
Feedback received during the Agency’s July 2021 stakeholder workshop and comment process 
expressed preference from stakeholders for additional lead time with visibility into the ILSFA Project 
Selection Protocols. Following the passage of Public Act 102-0662, further feedback was sought for 
guidance on updating Project Selection Protocols given updates to the legislation.  The Agency 
understands the importance of consistency of selection protocols for the development cycle and will 
update project selection protocols for program year 2022-2023 based on updates to the IPA Act as 
outlined in this 2022 Plan. The Project Selection Protocol developed for the 2022-2023 program year 
will be maintained without changes for the 2023-2024 program year to promote stability and 
certainty for Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors, with the exception of adding in the new criterion 
related to Energy Sovereignty. Any changes to the protocol for the 2024-2025 program year will be 
finalized at least six months before the start of the program year.   
8.10.3.  Customer Eligibility 
Customer eligibility for the Illinois Solar for All Program is partly defined in the Act. Further 
refinements are proposed in this section. 
270

271,279,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
8.10.3.1.  Income Guidelines 
Section 1-56(b) of the IPA Act states that, as used in that section (and thus for the Illinois Solar for All 
Program), “’low-income households’ means persons and families whose income does not exceed 80% 
of area median income, adjusted for family size and revised every 5 years.”536  
The Agency proposes to use income eligibility guidelines from HUD.  HUD bases its housing assistance 
programs, such as the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, on 80% of area median income, 
adjusted for family size.537 
Because the Act does not define “area,” the Agency is proposing to use HUD’s definition of an area as 
a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), a Fair Market Rate (FMR) Area, or a county not in an MSA or 
FMR.  There are 20 MSAs and FMRs, and 62 other counties in Illinois. 
Eligibility levels for Illinois Solar for All, based on HUD guidelines for every area and adjusted for 
family size, are presented in Appendix F.   HUD updated their income guidelines in June 2022, and 
Illinois Solar for All income guidelines have been updated with the 2022 HUD State Income Limits.  
For Fiscal Year 2017, the HUD eligibility income limits for Illinois as a whole are shown in the table 
below. For example, a family of four would be considered “low-income” if their household income 
were less than $59,300. (Actual eligibility depends on income for an area, rather than for the state as 
a whole.)  HUD has other programs that use “very low” and “extremely low” income measures, at 
50% and 30% of AMI that are provided here for reference. 538

It should be noted that other low-income energy programs, such as IHWAP and LIHEAP have 
eligibility guidelines that are updated each program year, based on the federal poverty level (not area 
income), with statewide values. Eligibility guidelines are set for households with income below 200%

of the previous year’s federal poverty level, depending on the program.  Illinois eligibility guidelines 
are set by the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and are shown in Table 8-8.539

6   $6,198  $74,380 
7   $6,985  $83,820 
8   $7,324  $93,260 
 
Although many households who qualify for LIHEAP and IHWAP will meet the 80% AMI eligibility 
guidelines of Illinois Solar for All, there are certain household sizes in particular counties where 
200% of FPL exceeds the local 80% AMI. The Program Administrator will still accept proof of LIHEAP 
or IHWAP approval as documentation of income eligibility, but with additional verification with 
DCEO to confirm household income eligibility to reduce inconvenience to the customer or the 
Approved Vendor. The tables in Appendix F compare HUD eligibility levels to LIHEAP and IHWAP 
income eligibility levels. 
Another approach would be to identify low-income customers by geographic area rather than by 
individual household income.  HUD’s “Qualified Census Tracts” are used to define eligibility for the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC).540 Qualified Census Tracts must have 50 percent of 
households with incomes below 60 percent of the Area Median Gross Income (AMGI) or have a 
poverty rate of 25 percent or more.  HUD has identified and mapped Qualified Census Tracts (“QCT”) 
nationwide. Overall, there are 657 QCTs in metropolitan areas in Illinois and 49 in non-metropolitan 
areas (out of 3,123 total census tracts in Illinois).  Cook County has the largest portion with 441.  
Springfield, which has 15 QCTs, is shown in Figure 8-2 as an example.   
The Agency previously used QCTs (along with subscriber affidavits) as a streamlined method for 
determining eligibility for low-income community solar subscribers. In its Final Order approving this 
2022 Long-Term Plan,541 the Commission directed the Agency to broaden this geographic eligibility 
method for low-income community solar to include census tracts where 50% of the households earn 
no more than 80% of AMI, to align with the Illinois Solar for All standard. The sections below on 
income verification reflect that change.

8.10.3.2.  Determining Income Eligibility 
The Agency proposes several approaches to determining income eligibility for the Illinois Solar for 
All Program.  
For projects that participate in the Low-income Distributed Generation Incentive Program sub-
program, verification of income should be done at the household resident level. This can be done in 
several ways. 
For buildings with between one and four units, household income can be verified by one of the 
following means:   
•  Review of the most recent federal income tax returns 
•  Income verification through a third-party income verification system 
•  Verification of participation in another low-income energy program (such as LIHEAP or state-
funded IHWAP), in HUD’s housing assistance programs where the income eligibility standard 
is 80% of AMI or lower for that participant, or in other benefits programs where the income 
eligibility limit is 80% of AMI. 
Additionally, while the Agency generally expects the Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor to verify 
a potential low-income community solar subscriber’s income through one of the methods described 
above, the Agency recognizes that some potential subscribers would prefer to have their income 
verified independently of their community solar subscription.  In such cases, the potential subscriber 
may request income verification directly through the Program Administrator and, if approved, that 
273 
 ",8. Illinois Solar for All ,[],297,7,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
274,282,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
verification would remain valid for 12 months.  The Program Administrator would provide the 
potential subscriber with a verification letter that could be provided to the Approved Vendor.542 
The  Agency  received  comments  suggesting  streamlining  of  the  income  verification  process, 
particularly for potential participants that demonstrate household-level third-party qualification 
such as LIHEAP or IHWAP.  Establishing income eligibility is a fundamental part of Illinois Solar for 
All. The Agency does acknowledge that improving processes and overall participant experience will 
be beneficial, and will work with the Program Administrator and stakeholders to identify ways to 
simplify the income verification process.  
For two- to four-unit buildings, at least two of the households in the building must qualify. For a 
multi-family building (five or more units), either at least 50% of the households must qualify, or the 
building owner may demonstrate that the building meets the definition of “affordable housing” 
contained in the Illinois Affordable Housing Act, namely: 
“Affordable housing” means residential housing that, so long as the same is occupied by 
low-income households or very low-income households, requires payment of monthly 
housing costs, including utilities other than telephone, of no more than 30% of the 
maximum allowable income as stated for such households as defined in this Section.543 
In  addition,  participation  in  energy  efficiency  programs  that  also  have  an  income  eligibility 
requirement that is equal to or less than 80% of AMI may also be considered a means of qualifying a 
multi-family building. 
For residential buildings of two or more units, the building owner will be required to agree to 
maintain at least half the units as affordable housing for a period of ten years. 
For low-income community solar projects, the Agency recognizes that transaction costs of proving 
income eligibility compared to the value of the incentive may be higher than for an installation of a 
project on-site, and therefore proposes a streamlined income verification approach:  
•  A subscriber can be verified as low-income via the same provisions used for the Low-
Income Distributed Generation Incentive sub-program. 
•  A subscriber can be verified as low-income if that subscriber resides in a census tract where 
at least 50% of residents earn no more than 80% of the AMI and provides a signed affidavit 
that they meet the income qualification level.544  
•  For master-metered five-unit and larger residential buildings, either at least 50% of the 
tenants must be verified as low-income, or the building must be demonstrated to meet the 
definition of “affordable housing” contained in the Illinois Affordable Housing Act.37 In 
addition to projects being eligible based on household income, subscriptions for homes or 
buildings that qualify for US Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) 
Project-Based Vouchers or Project-Based Rental Assistance (which are programs for housing 
units dedicated to low-income tenants) also qualify.  The income qualification levels required 
 
542 See Docket No. 19-0995, Final Order dated February 18, 2020 at 108. 
543 See 310 ILCS 65/3(e). Note that the definition of low-income household contained in that Act mirrors the definition used for Illinois 
Solar for All, and that very low-income households have an income standard that is even lower. 
544 This eligibility path changed from the Filed Plan. In its Final Order, the Commission required that the Agency immediately expand the 
acceptance of signed affidavits for community solar customers to applicants living in census tracts where 50% of residents make no more 
than 80% of the area median income. Previously, this option had only been open to those living in HUD Qualified Census Tracts, in which 
at least 50% of residents earn less than 60% of AMI. See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 122.

for participation in these programs is lower than income requirements for the Illinois Solar 
for All Program. 
It is the responsibility of the Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor to track subscribers and document 
income eligibility for community solar projects.545 Approved Vendors will be required to report to 
the Agency on subscription rates once a year.  Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors will not be 
required to verify that existing subscribers continue to meet the low-income eligibility requirements, 
but new subscribers over time will be required to meet those requirements. 
8.11.  Consumer Protections 
The 2022 Plan features a strong set of consumer protections as part of both the Adjustable Block 
Program and Illinois Solar for All for distributed generation and community solar. The protections 
detailed in Chapter 9 apply to both the Illinois Solar for All Program and the Adjustable Block 
Program. But several factors lead the Agency to require additional consumer protections that are 
unique to the Illinois Solar for All Program.  Thus, to be an Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor for 
the program, Approved Vendors must agree to the following additional provisions for low-income 
customers. 
•  In order to “ensure tangible economic benefits flow directly to program participants,” Illinois 
Solar for All Approved Vendors must also verify that there are no up-front payments for 
residential distributed generation program participants and no up-front subscription fees for 
community  solar  projects  (with  the  exception  of  nominal  fees  to  purchase  shares  in 
community solar projects organized as cooperative). Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors 
must also provide documentation to both the program participant(s), and to the Program 
Administrator explaining how the project or community solar subscription will result in a 
cash-flow positive experience for the participant(s) (including an estimate of the monthly 
savings) and specifically, ensuring that the savings accruing to each participant, net of any 
ongoing participation fees, are at least 50% of the value produced by the solar system through 
avoided usage or net metering credits.546 
 
•  For distributed generation projects, a site suitability report is required to ensure that projects 
are being installed on properties that will not need substantial structural, roofing or electrical 
repairs. If repairs are needed, the Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor must identify the 
plan for the repairs and how they will be paid for, ensuring that such costs do not place an 
unsustainable financial burden on the participant. While the site suitability report does not 
need to be completed prior to the program participant entering into a contract with the 
Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor (or their sub-contracted installer), if the site suitability 
report indicates that the project is not viable, the contract must contain a no-cost cancellation 
provision. 
 
•  Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors (or their Designees) are required to provide standard 
disclosures of all costs to program participants.  Under the Initial and First Revised Plans, the 
 
545 While generally the Agency would expect the Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor to verify a potential low-income community solar 
subscriber’s income through one of the methods described in this Plan, the Agency recognizes that some potential subscribers would prefer 
to have their income verified independently of their community solar subscription. In such cases, a potential subscriber may request 
income verification directly through the Program Administrator, and if approved, that verification would remain valid for six months. The 
Program Administrator would provide the potential subscriber with a verification letter that could be provided to the Approved Vendor. 
546 See Docket No. 17-0838, Final Order dated April 3, 2018 at 151.

Agency required that disclosure forms for Low-Income Distributed Generation projects be 
presented to customers at least seven calendar days prior to execution of the installation 
contract, and that customers also had the right to cancel their installation contract within 
seven calendar days following execution of that contract.  For this 2022 Plan, the Agency is 
eliminating the requirement to present and sign the disclosure seven calendar days prior to 
contract execution; instead, program participants may be presented with the disclosure form 
and installation contract contemporaneously, and that following the explanation of standard 
disclosures to the customer, those documents may also be executed contemporaneously.  To 
provide an additional consumer protection safeguard, this 2022 Plan, as approved by the 
Commission in its Final Order, extends the customer’s right to cancellation from 7 calendar 
days to 14 calendar days.  For contracts related to subscriptions to Low-Income Community 
Solar Project Initiative projects or Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Procurement projects, 
customers shall have the right to cancel the subscription agreement within three calendar 
days after its initial consummation, and to cancel subscriptions at any time with a 30-day 
notice. 
 
•  Financing amounts, terms, and conditions must be based on an assessment of the program 
participant’s ability to repay the debt, as defined by Regulation Z, which is a federal rule that 
implements aspects of the Truth in Lending Act and the Dodd-Frank Act.547   
 
•  For low-income customers, loans should not be secured by the program participant’s home 
or home equity.  While such unsecured loans may entail a higher interest rate, especially for 
customers with low credit scores or little credit history, they avoid the risk of liens and 
foreclosures for customers who default on their loans.548 
 
•  Contracts for financial products must offer terms that include forbearance.  If a program 
participant can show good cause in a request for forbearance, financers must offer a) 
suspension of total payments for up to three months, b) a suspension of interest payments 
for up to six months, or c) a reduction in interest rates for up to twelve months.  Missed 
revenues may be recovered later in the stage of the contract, but no interest may be applied. 
 
•  Contracts may not include prepayment penalties. 
 
•  For this 2022 Long-Term Plan, the Agency clarifies that lease or PPA agreements that allow 
for ownership of the system to be fully transferred to the participant prior to the 15-year 
term  of  the  REC  agreement  will  be  allowed  only  in  circumstances  where  full  system 
warranties and full coverage of operations and maintenance needs are included at no 
additional cost. In these instances, the first-year savings must still meet the minimum 
requirement and the lifetime savings will be calculated based on a 25-year life of the system.

simultaneous loan; (5) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (6) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support;

years, contract terms may include the following:  the timing of the transfer, the amount of 
Illinois Solar for All funds held in escrow to pay for the transfer, the purchase price of the 
system at the time of expected transfer, and a transfer of warranties to the new owner. 
Contract terms must be approved by the Program Administrator at the time of project 
application. 
 
For Energy Sovereignty community solar projects where individual panels are owned by an 
eligible customer, the contract should include the purchase price of the panels net of Illinois 
Solar for All incentives.  If ownership is transferred after tax benefits are captured, the 
contract should specify where applicable: the timing of the transfer, the price of the system 
at the time of transfer, funds held in escrow for the buyer, plans for ongoing monitoring and 
maintenance after the transfer of ownership, and other factors described for distributed 
generation projects.  
 
•  Marketing and contractual materials must be in the language requested by the customer.  The 
Agency  reaffirms  its commitment  to  develop  program materials  in  Spanish  and  other 
languages to better reach underserved communities.  Approved Vendors will be expected to 
provide the ILSFA program brochure and disclosure in the participant’s preferred language, 
if available from the Program Administrator. 
 
•  Contracts must allow a grace period of at least seven calendar days after the customer 
payment due date before late fees are charged. 
 
•  All Illinois Solar for All contracts must include full system warranty, as well as operations and 
maintenance guarantees for the duration of the REC Contract or 15 years, at no additional 
cost  to  participants.  Updated  ILSFA  disclosures  will  include  customer  instructions  for 
insuring the system. Further details of minimum standards for scope will be clarified in the 
ILSFA Approved Vendor Manual with feedback from stakeholders.  
8.12.  Environmental Justice Communities 
The Act directs the Agency to define and provide special consideration to Environmental Justice 
Communities in implementing the Illinois Solar for All Program.  The Act sets a goal that at least 25% 
of funds for the Low-Income Distributed Generation Incentive, the incentives for non-profit and 
public facilities, and Low-Income Community Solar projects sub-programs “be allocated to projects 
located in environmental justice communities.”549 (The provision did not apply to the Low-Income 
Community Solar Pilot Projects, which was competitively bid.) 
Through changes to Illinois law made by Public Act 102-0662, other programs and state agencies 
now rely on the definitions of environmental justice communities developed by this methodology for 
their determinations of program and funding eligibility. Accordingly, the Agency will be cautious 
about any changes to the determination of environmental justice communities that would have 
cascading impact on those other provisions. 
The following sections include definitions of terms, a methodology for determining which Illinois 
communities  should  be  considered  Environmental  Justice  Communities,  and  how  the  Agency 
determined to implement the relevant provisions of the Act.  In developing the Illinois Solar for All

program participation requirements, the Agency committed to consulting with stakeholders and 
relevant state agencies, including the Illinois Commission on Environmental Justice and the Illinois 
Environmental  Protection  Agency  (“IEPA”),  to  establish  specific  values  and  designate  specific 
communities as Environmental Justice Communities; the results of that process are outlined within 
this section. 
8.12.1.  Definitions  
Section 1-56(b) of the IPA Act as amended by P.A. 102-0662 states that “the Agency shall define 
‘environmental justice community’ based on the methodologies and findings established by the 
Agency and the Administrator for the Illinois Solar for All Program in its initial long-term renewable 
resources procurement plan and as updated by the Agency and the Administrator for the Illinois 
Solar for All Program as part of the long-term renewable resources procurement plan update.” The 
term “environmental justice” is not defined in the Act or in other Illinois statutes, but it is helpful to 
define “environmental justice” in order to define “environmental justice communities.”   
The  Environmental  Justice  Act,  the  1997  legislation  that  created  the  Illinois  Commission  on 
Environmental Justice, found that: 
(i) the principle of environmental justice requires that no segment of the population, 
regardless of race, national origin, age, or income, should bear disproportionately high 
or adverse effects of environmental pollution; 
(ii) certain communities in the State may suffer disproportionately from environmental 
hazards related to facilities with permits approved by the State; and 
(iii) these environmental hazards can cause long-term health effects.550 
The Illinois EPA defines the term ""environmental justice "" as follows: 
""Environmental Justice"" is based on the principle that all people should be protected 
from environmental pollution and have the right to a clean and healthy environment. 
Environmental justice is the protection of the health of the people of Illinois and its 
environment, equity in the administration of the State's environmental programs, and 
the provision of adequate opportunities for meaningful involvement of all people with 
respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, 
regulations, and policies.551 
The Illinois EPA has also defined what it terms “an area of EJ concern” based on demographic factors, 
as “a census block group with a low-income and/or minority population greater than twice the 
statewide average.” The IEPA “uses a geographic information system (GIS) mapping tool called EJ 
Start to determine where areas of EJ concern are within the state. When a permitting action or other 
issue arises in an area of EJ concern, the Illinois EPA conducts enhanced public outreach.”552 Thus, 
the Illinois EPA takes a preemptive approach, identifying areas that may be more vulnerable to 
environmental hazards and including the community before potential pollution occurs.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines an “overburdened community” under 
both social and environmental terms as:  
Minority, low-income, tribal, or indigenous populations or geographic locations in the 
United States that potentially experience disproportionate environmental harms and 
risks. This disproportionality can be as a result of greater vulnerability to environmental 
hazards,  lack  of  opportunity  for  public  participation,  or  other  factors.  Increased 
vulnerability may be attributable to an accumulation of negative or lack of positive 
environmental, health, economic, or social conditions within these populations or 
places.  The  term  describes  situations  where  multiple  factors,  including  both 
environmental and socio-economic stressors, may act cumulatively to affect health and 
the environment and contribute to persistent environmental health disparities.553 
Both  the  IEPA  and  US  EPA  have  developed  analytical  tools  based  on  their  definitions  of  EJ 
communities.  The IEPA’s EJ START is a Geographic Information Systems demographic screening tool 
developed by IEPA staff that identifies regions with high minority population and/or low-income 
population. IEPA also adds a one-mile buffer around each regulated facility as a simplified way to 
identify  potential  local  environmental  impacts.  It  draws  from  the  Census  Bureau’s  American 
Community Survey 5-year estimates (2011-2015) and is updated annually.  
The US EPA tool is called EJSCREEN.554 It uses standard and nationally-consistent data to identify 
communities with greater risk of exposure to pollution based on 11 environmental indicators that 
measure potential exposure, hazard/risk and proximity, including traffic proximity, particulate 
matter, and proximity to superfund sites. These indicators are combined with demographic data from 
the Census Bureau, enabling users to identify areas with minority or low- income populations who 
also face potential pollution issues.  
While these tools are useful, they do not holistically address all aspects of environmental justice. For 
example, EJSCREEN evaluates individual environmental indicators but does not look at cumulative 
impacts.  
The  most  rigorous  tool  for  analyzing  impacted  communities  is  the  California  Communities 
Environmental  Health  Screening  Tool  (“CalEnviroScreen”)  from  the  California  Office  of 
Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (“OEHHA”).555  CalEnviroScreen compiles data on 12 
indicators of pollution burden and 8 population characteristics collected at the Census tract level.  It 
then weights certain factors to develop a score for each area.  High scoring areas are then considered 
eligible for a number of state policies, including disposition of some of the revenues from the state 
cap-and-trade program created under Assembly Bill 32.

The CalEnviroScreen approach is an attractive way to consider defining environmental justice 
communities but the Agency notes that the development of it was a multi-year, multi-million dollar 
undertaking. Therefore, the Agency will utilize a streamlined approach that takes the concept of 
CalEnviroScreen and simplifies it for use in Illinois through using readily available data from the U.S 
EPA’s EJSCREEN tool. CalEnviroScreen does not account for race in its calculations, but by using data 
from EJSCREEN, the Agency will be able to do so. 
The federal government’s U.S. Digital Service, working with the Council on Environmental Quality, is 
developing the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (“CEJST”) to guide federal programs 
under the Justice40 initiative (Executive Order 14008). The tool expands and improves EJSCREEN, 
featuring  interactive  maps  with  indicators  to  assist  agencies  in  defining  and  identifying 
disadvantaged communities. The beta version of the CEJST was launched on February 18, 2022, for 
comment, and will be updated in the near future to incorporate public comments. When the final tool 
is  available,  the  IPA  will  review  the  results  and  evaluate  if  it  results  in  any  changes  to  the 
consideration of environmental justice communities contained herein. 
8.12.2.  Approach for Defining Environmental Justice Communities 
The Agency determined which areas qualify as Environmental Justice Communities by analyzing data 
from Illinois census block groups556 for the following environmental indicators, as described by the 
EJSCREEN Tool:557 
•  National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) air toxics cancer risk 
•  NATA respiratory hazard index 
 
556 There are approximately 10,000 census block groups in the state of Illinois. 
557 See https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-environmental-indicators-ejscreen.

281,289,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
•  NATA diesel PM 
•  Particulate matter 
•  Ozone 
•  Traffic proximity and volume 
•  Lead paint indicator 
•  Proximity to Risk Management Plan sites 
•  Proximity to Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities 
•  Proximity to National Priorities List sites 
•  Wastewater Dischargers Indicator 
The following demographic indicators are also used by EJSCREEN and were incorporated into the 
Agency’s methodology:558 
•  Percent Low-Income 
•  Percent Minority 
•  Less than high school education 
•  Linguistic isolation 
•  Individuals under age 5 
•  Individuals over age 64 
The Agency considered including the following seven indicators that use data not contained in 
EJSCREEN. These are not available at the same level of detail as the indicators using data from 
EJSCREEN (more typically they have data at the zip code or county level) and would need to be 
translated to the block group level. Therefore, the Agency determined in the final methodology that 
these indicators would be too difficult to incorporate to provide meaningful impact on the evaluation 
criteria.  Namely, these include the following demographic indicators for Sensitive Population 
Characteristics from the Illinois Department of Public Health: 
•  Asthma Emergency Department Visits 
•  Low Birth Weight Infants 
and the following environmental indicators from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency: 
•  Drinking Water Watch 
•  Site remediation program 
•  Leaking Underground Storage Tank Incident Tracking 
•  State Response Action Program 
•  Solid Waste Facilities 
Using the eleven environmental and six demographic factors listed at the top of this section, the 
Agency then weighted each factor using an approach adapted from CalEnviroScreen: census block 
groups were ranked for each environmental and demographic indicator, a resulting percentile score 
determined for each census block group within each indicator, and the percentile scores averaged, 
resulting in an environmental score and a demographic score for each census block group. The two

averages were then multiplied together to determine a single Environmental Justice score for each 
census block group. 
Figure 8-3: CalEnviroScreen Formula 
 
Source:  OEHHA 
 
Communities with scores in the top 25% of all census block groups statewide are defined as 
Environmental Justice Communities for the purpose of the Illinois Solar for All Program. This 
definition will be used to target grassroots education funding and incentives for the Low-income 
Single-Family  and  Small  Multifamily  Solar,  the  Low-income  Large  Multifamily  Solar,  Non-
profits/Public Facilities, and Low-income Community Solar sub-programs. 
A community that is not in the top 25% of scores and thus is not initially defined as being an 
Environmental  Justice  Community  may  request  that  the  Agency  consider  designating  that 
community as such. The Agency will consider requests from community-based organizations, local 
units of government, or community residents for self-designation as an environmental justice 
community  based  on  demonstrated  quantitative  and  qualitative  environmental  and/or 
socioeconomic factors that show a disproportionate burden and were not adequately captured in the 
screening defined above. A request for self-designation must be approved through an Environmental 
Justice Community Self-Designation Process559 prior to any project application being submitted that 
seeks to utilize its location in an approved self-designated Environmental Justice Community as part 
of its project selection. 
The Agency notes that this approach focuses on analysis of census block group-level data, and that 
communities are typically understood by their residents to be defined through geographic, cultural, 
and other factors that may, or may not, correspond to census block group boundaries. In addition, 
the US EPA cautions that data in the EJSCREEN tool is not always reliable at the block group level, 
and recommends that it may be necessary to aggregate up to larger geographic areas in a “buffer 
report.”560 
 
559  The  initial  Self-Designation  Process  developed  by  the  Agency  and  Program  Administrator  can  be  found  at 
https://www.illinoissfa.com/app/uploads/2019/05/042219EJ-Self-Designation-Process_Final.pdf.  The Agency reserves the right to 
modify this process in the future based on program experience.

The Agency will therefore also consider reasonable adjustments to the borders of environmental 
justice communities from what is calculated through the census block group analysis, provided this 
does not create an unacceptable analytical burden. 
8.12.3.  Environmental Justice Community Designations 
The Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator undertook the analysis described in Section 8.12.2 
in early 2019 prior to the program launch, which included a workshop and an opportunity for written 
stakeholder comments. The resulting interactive map of Environmental Justice Communities, as well 
as information from that stakeholder process, is available at www.illinoissfa.com/environmental-
justice-communities. The map of environmental justice communities will be updated at least on a 
semiannual basis to reflect any additional approved requests for self-designation. 
The EJSCREEN data used to determine Illinois Solar for All Program-determined Environmental 
Justice Communities will be updated, and the Environmental Justice Community maps refigured, 
based on updated data from each Illinois Solar for All program year.  Previously designated Self-
Designated Environmental Justice Communities will be maintained through this update.  To allow for 
project development cycles that may overlap with these changes, for the 2022-2023 program year, 
the initial and updated Environmental Justice Community determinations will both be considered as 
meeting program Environmental Justice goals and selection points.  Following the updates to the 
Illinois Solar for All Environmental Justice maps, the Program Administrator and the Agency will 
explore the scope of changes between the maps to advise a future proposal of a regular schedule to 
update Illinois Solar for All Environmental Justice maps.  
8.12.4.  Environmental Justice Communities 25% Goal 
The Act states that “It is a goal of this program that a minimum of 25% of the incentives for this 
program be allocated to projects located within environmental justice communities.”561    
For all sub-programs, the Agency will reserve 25% of each sub-program’s annual budget to support 
projects in environmental justice communities.  If the 25% of funds in each sub-program are fully 
allocated to projects in environmental justice communities, then subsequent applicant projects in 
environmental justice communities would still be eligible using the general available budgets. The 
25% reservation of funds for environmental justice communities will be held open within a sub-
program until filled within a program year, then reset at the beginning of each new program year. 
To help ensure that environmental justice communities are made aware of opportunities for 
participation in ILSFA, grassroots education funding will be prioritized towards Environmental 
Justice Communities to help meet this goal. Up to 60% of the funding (or 3 percentage points of the 
5%) will be used for this purpose. 
8.13.  Program Changes 
Several provisions in the Act anticipate the ability to revise program provisions. In addition to the 
provision described in Section 1-56(b)(4) of the Act, updated by Public Act 102-0662, that allows 
stakeholders to propose additional programs, Section 1-56(b)(2) allows the Agency to reallocate 
funds between programs: 
 
561 20 ILCS 3855/1-56(b)(2).

284,292,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
The allocation of funds among subparagraphs (A), (B), (C) and (E) of this paragraph (2) 
may be changed if the Agency, after receiving input through a stakeholder process, 
determines incentives in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), or (E) of this paragraph (2) have 
not been adequately subscribed to fully utilize available Illinois Solar for All Program 
funds.562 
With this 2022 Plan, the Agency updates the allocation of funds between the sub-programs as 
updated by Public Act 102-0662. 
For this 2022 Plan the Agency has throughout this Chapter proposed a variety of adjustments to the 
program pursuant to the following provision: 
Following the Commission's approval of the Illinois Solar for All Program, the Agency or 
a party may propose adjustments to the program terms, conditions, and requirements, 
including the price offered to new systems, to ensure the long-term viability and success 
of the program. The Commission shall review and approve any modifications to the 
program through the plan revision process described in Section 16-111.5 of the Public 
Utilities Act.563 
Stakeholders have suggested a more collaborative stakeholder feedback process, rather than issue- 
or point-in-time specific engagements. The Agency will work with the Program Administrator to 
create  an  ongoing  stakeholder  engagement  process  to  gather  feedback  on  ongoing  program 
performance, changes, and progress. These more general progress sessions will be held at least 
quarterly.  Further details about this ILSFA Stakeholder Advisory Group can be found in Section 8.17. 
Further, the Agency and Program Administrator may consider piloting program or process changes 
on a limited scale to better understand and measure those changes’ effectiveness before making long 
term changes to the Illinois Solar for All Program. For example, a pilot may involve coordination with 
third-party energy efficiency program administrator or community action agency to develop a 
process that would facilitate connecting participants in energy efficiency programs with Illinois Solar 
for All Approved Vendors or provide initial site suitability screening. 
8.14.  Evaluation 
Section 1-56(b)(6) requires that this Plan include an approach for independent evaluation of the 
Illinois Solar for All Program: 
At least every 2 years, the Agency shall select an independent evaluator to review and 
report on the Illinois Solar for All Program and the performance of the third-party 
program administrator of the Illinois Solar for All Program. The evaluation shall be 
based on objective criteria developed through a public stakeholder process. The process 
shall  include  feedback  and  participation  from  Illinois  Solar  for  All  Program 
stakeholders, including participants and organizations in environmental justice and 
historically underserved communities. The report shall include a summary of the 
evaluation of the Illinois Solar for All Program based on the stakeholder developed 
objective criteria. The report shall include the number of projects installed; the total 
installed capacity in kilowatts; the average cost per kilowatt of installed capacity to the 
 
562 20 ILCS 3855/1-56(b)(2). 
563 20 ILCS 3855/1-56(b)(4).

extent reasonably obtainable by the Agency; the number of jobs or job opportunities 
created;  economic,  social,  and  environmental  benefits  created;  and  the  total 
administrative costs expended by the Agency and program administrator to implement 
and evaluate the program. 
In January 2019, the Agency held a workshop and took stakeholder feedback to assist in the 
development of the scope and process for the evaluation.564 The Agency then issued a Request for 
Qualifications/Request for Proposals to select an independent evaluator to conduct the evaluation.565 
This selection process is expressly exempted from the Illinois Procurement Code.566  On August 7, 
2019, the Commission approved the contract for the Agency’s selected evaluator, APPRISE, Inc. 
The Act calls for an evaluation “at least every 2 years,” but the Agency notes that Illinois Solar for All 
did not launch for project applications until May 2019. The Phase I Evaluation Report, released in 
October 2019, focused on the stakeholder outreach process, development of program materials and 
guidelines, initial Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor registration, initial project applications, and 
the development of Grassroots Education efforts, and was included in Appendix G of the First Revised 
Plan. Four Phase II Evaluation Reports were completed in 2020 and 2021, which detail the first two 
years of ILSFA activities through program year 2021-2022 and provide recommendations for 
program improvement.  The Illinois Solar for All Evaluation Summary Report was also created to 
provide a succinct overview of program design, metrics, and recommendations found in the Phase I 
and Phase II evaluation reports.567 
Recommendations from the Phase II Final Evaluation Report are summarized below. The Phase II 
Final  Evaluation  Report  is  included  as  Appendix  H  to  this  2022  Plan.  Generally,  these 
recommendations do not require specific changes to the Plan but rather can be considered and 
potentially implemented through ongoing program administration, and the Program Administrator 
has or will be implementing many of these recommendations.  Where applicable, changes proposed 
in this 2022 Plan reflect these recommendations. 
Recommendations 
•  Low-Income Distributed Generation Sub-program Project Barriers:  Continue to reduce 
barriers  to  development  of  DG  projects.  This  may  include  exploring  where  program 
requirements can be reduced, reducing or removing the waiting period between disclosure 
and contract execution, and reducing the batch requirement for the first set of projects.  Also 
increase outreach to Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors to encourage them to develop 
more standard offers for the list provided to potential participants, and work with the 
Chicago Porch and Roof Replacement Program and similar programs to target households 
that may have already had roof repair. 
•  Utility Screening: Future legislation could be considered that specifies how utilities engage 
with ILSFA and provides funding to support other aspects of project development.

•  Limit Program Changes: Program design changes should focus on refinements that reduce 
barriers to participation in the Low-Income Distributed Generation sub-program. This will 
allow  the  Program  Administrator  to  focus  on  streamlining  project  development  and 
implementation processes. 
•  ILSFA  Website:  The  ILSFA  website  design  can be  improved  to  make  it  easier  to  find 
information and understand the program. 
•  ILSFA Portal:  The portal has been adapted as the program has grown, and there are 
opportunities  to  streamline,  reduce  redundancies  and  increase  user-friendly  design 
elements. 
•  Green Bank: Develop plans for how a Green Bank can aid Illinois Solar for All Approved 
Vendors in project financing if enabling legislation is enacted. 
•  Stakeholder Outreach: Implement proactive outreach to stakeholders beyond current email 
blasts, and engage community action agencies and other organizations that serve low-income 
households. 
•  DG Screening: Develop and implement a process to work collaboratively with the community 
action agencies that administer LIHEAP and IHWAP. 
•  Part  II  Process:    Reduce  challenges  with  document  and  photo  uploading,  job  training 
document collection, and documentation redundancies. 
The Agency plans to begin the process of selecting an Evaluator for the next two-year period starting 
in the fall of 2022. The Evaluator selection process will include opportunities for stakeholder input 
in the evaluation design.  The next phase of evaluation of the Illinois Solar for All Program will 
include evaluation of pilot programs proposed in this Chapter. 
8.15.  Grassroots Education Funding 
Section 1-56(b)(3) of the IPA Act as amended by Public Act 102-0662 also requires that the Agency  
“direct that up to 5% of the funds available under the Illinois Solar for All Program to community-
based groups and other qualifying organizations to assist in community-driven education efforts 
related to the Illinois Solar for All Program, including general energy education, job training program 
outreach efforts, and other activities deemed to be qualified by the Agency.”568  For the initial 
program years, the Agency interpreted the “funds available under the [Program]” to be the annual 
contribution of approximately $11.7 million from the Renewable Resources Budget under Section 1-
75(c)(1)(O) of the Act, plus $16.5 million allocated annually from the RERF for the three non-
competitive sub-programs, plus $2.5 million allocated annually from the RERF for the Low-Income 
Community Solar Pilot Projects.569  Therefore, the maximum available annual budget for grassroots 
education was $1.53 million for these two program years; the Agency awarded $449,464 for 
 
568 20 ILCS 3855/1-56(b)(3). 
569 While for three of the sub-programs there are defined program year funding levels available, that concept did not apply cleanly to the 
Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Project sub-program. For simplicity, the Agency proposed to allocate the total available funding for 
that sub-program ($37.5 million) over 15 years, which is the length of time that projects from the sub-program would be delivering RECs 
to the Solar for All Program. 
286

community grassroots education campaigns in the 2019-2020 program year, $499,094 in the 2020-
2021 program year, and $500,000 in the 2021-2022 program year. With the utility funding available 
for Illinois Solar for All increasing to $50 million per year in addition to funding from the Renewable 
Energy Resources Fund, funding for grassroots education is potentially very substantial and the 
Agency will continue to assess what is an appropriate funding level.  With expanded budgets allowed 
by CEJA, up to $3.325 million (5% of $66.5 million) would be available to support grassroots 
education funding. 
For the purposes of grassroots education, community-based organizations must be registered non-
profit  entities,  excluding  trade  or  political  non-profits.  It  is  recognized  that  the  definition  of 
community-based organizations or non-profit is very broad and may include a variety of organization 
types. It is not required that non-profit organizations have federal 501(c)(3) status, and collaborative 
or fiscal sponsorship should be encouraged to ensure that very small, hyper-local organizations can 
participate. Qualified organizations should work within the communities in which they will be 
providing grassroots education.  Grassroots educator entities will be chosen through competitive 
RFPs issued periodically and selected grassroots educators will be subcontractors of the ILSFA 
Program Administrator. Pursuant to the Initial Plan, the first selection of grassroots educators was 
made in June 2019.570 
As noted in Section 8.12.4, grassroots education funding will be prioritized towards Environmental 
Justice Communities to help meet this goal. Up to 60% of the funding (or 3 percentage points of the 
5%) will be used for this purpose. Grassroots education topics could include solar basics, program 
requirements, consumer protection, program benefits and opportunities, job training opportunities, 
environmental justice community issues, or community engagement, among many others. One 
objective of the grassroots education strategy will be to ensure that campaigns collectively reach a 
diversity of households and communities, topics, and geographies over time. 
Public Act 102-0662 updated language directing grassroots education efforts to clarify, “Grassroots 
education funding shall not be used to support the marketing by solar project development firms and 
organizations, unless such education provides equal opportunities for all applicable firms and 
organizations.”  Non-profit  organizations  providing  grassroots  education  to  communities  must 
ensure that outreach and education provided does not serve the interest of any Approved Vendor or 
other solar developer above any other. When grassroots education events are open to Illinois Solar 
for All Approved Vendors, all Approved Vendors should have an equal opportunity to participate in 
a transparent manner. No organization providing grassroots education services should have a 
current financial relationship with an Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendor where the grassroots 
education organization receives payment for such services, and any past relationships should be 
clearly  disclosed  when  submitting  proposals.  Community-based  organizations  may  work  with 
Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors in the capacity of developing a solar project for their own 
property.    Community-based  organizations  receiving  grassroots  education  funding  are  also 
permitted to provide referrals to Illinois Solar for All Approved Vendors who request assistance in 
identifying  either  community  organizations  or  property  owners  that  are  interested  in  seeing 
community solar projects developed in their communities, provided there are no financial payments

or other benefits received by the grassroots education funding recipient in exchange for such 
referrals.   
The Agency will conduct a special request for proposals to contract a community organization with 
experience in job placement services to conduct an educational campaign to connect Illinois Solar for 
All Approved Vendors with interested trainees.  This will supplement (not replace) the job trainee 
clearinghouse to be maintained by the Program Administrator discussed in Section 8.6.   
Section 1-56(b)(2) directs the Agency to coordinate ILSFA program administration “with similar 
initiatives, including … energy efficiency programs, job training programs, and community action 
agencies.”  
Community action agencies and other entities offer the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance 
Program and other energy efficiency services to low-income households in Illinois.  Their work offers 
a synergistic opportunity to engage with the same households that are eligible for the Illinois Solar 
for All program. 
The Agency and the Program Administrator have made progress in coordinating with CAAs and 
utility-run energy efficiency programs, and individual Approved Vendors can and have developed 
partnerships with specific CAAs. 
Public Act 99-0906 instructs the Agency to support “grassroots education efforts related to the 
Illinois Solar for All Program.” To date, funded grassroots education campaigns have specifically 
focused on community education by local community organizations.  The Agency and Program 
Administrator have experienced challenges engaging community action agencies and other low-
income energy efficiency service providers that could potentially incorporate a solar assessment 
because the Agency does not believe these services can be considered “community education,” and 
thus not eligible for grassroots education funding, although such activities could potentially promote 
and simplify ILSFA participation.  The Agency believes the updated language of 1-56(b)(2) in Public 
Act 102-0662, which adds “and other activities deemed to be qualified by the Agency,” expands the 
kinds of activities covered by this funding to include non-educational activities, such as costs for low-
income energy efficiency providers to perform preliminary site suitability assessments, and other 
activities and services that can be performed by community organizations to drive and facilitate 
ILSFA participation.  The Agency will explore expanding the types of activities campaigns support by 
grassroots education funding, or perform a separate targeted RFP for specific activities to drive ILSFA 
participation. 
Specific opportunities for this expanded use of grassroots education funding could include finding 
ways to coordinate customer enrollment, assist with income verification, and program promotion. 
Any new activities supported by grassroots education funding that involve or impact existing state 
energy efficiency programs will seek input from the advisory groups, utilities, and stakeholders 
associated with those programs. 571 
At a minimum, the Program Administrator will seek to work with Approved Vendors and CAAs to 
develop materials that can be shared with customers to cross-promote the programs.

Customers who have already received income-qualified energy efficiency or health and safety repairs 
can be referred to the ILSFA program, once protocols have been established for sharing customer 
information. CAAs could be supported in part for the costs associated with site assessment and 
referrals to the ILSFA program.  Weatherization and solar marketers could offer combined efficiency 
and solar products, or CAAs could register as Approved Vendors for ILSFA.  
The Agency will convene parties interested in this collaboration and develop ideas that improve 
program delivery. 
8.16.  Ongoing Research and Education 
The Illinois Solar for All Program aims to bring the benefits of solar power to low-income, non-profit, 
and public sector customers, environmental justice communities, and Illinois workers.    
Illinois Solar for All takes place in the context of a wide range of energy, social, and economic policies 
and  programs  from  federal,  state,  and  local  governments.  Moreover,  business  and  social 
entrepreneurs are developing innovative approaches to deployment. Both of these factors lead to a 
complicated  and  shifting  landscape  for  the  role  of  solar  energy  in  addressing  social  and 
environmental inequities. 
Many states are exploring policy approaches that combine climate action and equity, with a strong 
focus  on  low-income  solar  development.  The  Agency  believes  that  Illinois  stakeholders  and 
practitioners would benefit from ongoing study of opportunities and best practices in other states 
that would improve the execution of the Illinois Solar for All Program. 
While the Act establishes a number of working groups and advisory councils to provide input on 
clean energy programs, no such formal process has been established for Illinois Solar for All. A 
number of stakeholders commented on the need for ongoing public input and dialogue around 
Illinois Solar for All.  The Agency strongly supports such a process, and points to the Community Solar 
Energy Sovereignty Grant Program, established in Section 5-60(e) of the Energy Transition Act 
enacted through Public Act 102-0662, managed by the DCEO, which may be used “to support the 
development of programs and entities to assist in the long-term governance, management, and 
maintenance of community solar projects, such as community solar cooperatives."" Examples of 
eligible  tasks  include  ""development  of  cooperative  or  community  ownership  model;  and 
development of project models that allocate benefits to equity investment eligible communities."" The 
Agency will explore avenues to collaborate with the DCEO on the execution of such an initiative. 
8.17.  Illinois Solar for All Advisory Group 
The Agency will convene an Illinois Solar for All Advisory Group, to develop and explore ideas and 
advise the Agency on the ILSFA program.  The group will meet regularly, and representatives will be 
invited from the Agency, the Illinois Commerce Commission, the ILSFA Program Administrator, 
Approved  Vendors,  Approved  Vendor  Aggregators,  Equity-Eligible  Contractors,  industry 
participants,  grassroots  educators  or  local  organizations,  the  public,  and  other  interested 
stakeholders.  The Stakeholder Advisory Group may also engage with other agencies coordinating 
with ILSFA, such as DCEO and IFA. 
The Advisory Group meetings are intended to foster meaningful and informed conversation between 
all program stakeholder and agencies, provide education or information regarding participation in 
the program, encourage stakeholder and public feedback, and develop and propose incremental

improvements to the ILSFA program. Ultimate decisions on if or how to implement Advisory Group 
recommendations will remain with the Agency. 
Meetings will be held online and in-person, if possible, on a regular basis, with a target of once a 
month. The Agency will create an email list for interested parties to keep informed of Advisory Group 
activities and will post the schedule and materials for meetings on the IPA and Illinois Solar for All 
websites.572  These meetings will be in addition to public stakeholder engagement sessions, which 
the Agency holds on an as-needed basis and are open to the public.

9. Consumer Protection 
In prior iterations of the Long-Term Plan, terms, conditions, and requirements for participation in 
the Adjustable Block Program and the Illinois Solar for All Program were located in the chapters 
outlining program requirements for each.  This chapter consolidates discussion of those consumer 
protection program requirements applicable across both programs, while expanding the Plan’s 
discussion of consumer protection in light of revisions made to Section 1-75(c)(1)(M) of the Act 
through P.A. 102-0662. 
9.1.  Consumer Protection Requirements under Prior Long-Term Plans  
The Agency has considered the development of safeguards for consumers a vital component in 
ensuring the success of the Adjustable Block Program and Illinois Solar for All.  A project that 
successfully applies to one of these programs stands to receive a financial benefit from the program 
in the form of a REC delivery contract and by extension from the ratepayers who fund it.  Requiring 
clear  and  consistent  information  on  the  relationships  among  the  end  customer,  the 
installer/developer, and the Approved Vendor is critical to ensuring that the fiscal risks and controls 
of these programs are properly and prudently managed. 
As explained in prior plans, installation of a photovoltaic system is a significant financial commitment 
on behalf of that system’s host (and potential owner).  A system that has been sold (or leased) to a 
customer using incorrect, inaccurate, or deceptive information could put the financial security of 
Illinois residents or businesses at risk and poison the ongoing viability of the Illinois solar market.   
While subscribing to a community renewable generation project is not the same as choosing to 
purchase, lease, or otherwise host a system located on one’s own property, it bears similarities to 
signing up to take supply service from an Alternative Retail Electric Supplier (“ARES”) and includes 
a binding contractual commitment.  The Agency has observed that the history of questionable 
marketing practices of some Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers gives reason to ensure significant 
safeguards are in place around the marketing of community renewable generation subscriptions.573  
The troubling practices observed from alternative gas and electric suppliers include: improperly 
associating the supplier with the local utility or a government agency or program; implying that a 
customer must choose to enroll; inflating the price of green energy offers far beyond the actual 
incremental cost of procuring renewable resources; and targeting elderly, non-English speaking, and 
low-income customers who may have less access to quality information about energy prices. 
The Initial and Revised Plans thus featured consumer protection requirements developed mindful of 
the state’s experience with the retail energy supply market and the marketing and sale of energy-
related products.  As such, the IPA originally sought to tap into the experience and institutional 
knowledge reflected in requirements applicable to alternative retail electric suppliers.  While 
 
573  See, e.g., ICC Docket No. 14-0512, Consumer Services Division and Office of Retail Market Development Staff Report to the Commission 
dated August 20, 2014, https://www.icc.illinois.gov/downloads/public/edocket/384622.pdf (detailing misleading and noncompliant

including unauthorized switching, misrepresentation of the nature of the transaction, misrepresentation of identity of the ARES, 
misrepresentation of price or savings, failure to disclose cancellation fees or right to cancel, and more); ICC Docket No. 17-0273, Order, 
August 15, 2017, at 4-5 (denying a certificate of service authority to an ARES that, previously operating in Illinois under a prior corporate 
structure, had amassed numerous complaints related to sales and marketing).

Approved Vendors would not necessarily be Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers, and thus as 
Approved Vendors are not governed as a matter of law by the Commission’s Rules applicable to ARES, 
the IPA found that the Commission’s Title 83, Part 412 rules provided a workable blueprint for 
expectations of Approved Vendors.  Therefore, as a condition of ongoing approval, Approved Vendors 
are and have been expected to comply with marketing standards generally equivalent to the 
Commission-approved rules for marketing practices by alternative retail electric suppliers.574    
The Agency recognizes that it is not a regulatory agency and does not have jurisdiction over all 
distributed generation installations or community solar projects across the state.  However, the 
Agency can and did create common sense provisions to ensure that entities developing projects 
seeking to participate in the Adjustable Block and Illinois Solar for All Programs are held to high 
standards for consumer protection.  As the entities tasked by law with determining participation 
eligibility and enforcing program terms, conditions, and requirements on participant firms, those 
programs’ respective Program Administrators enforce consumer protection provisions through 
disciplinary actions, including issuing formal warnings, placing entities on probation, and when 
necessary, suspending non-compliant entities from further participation in these state-administered 
incentive programs. As the Program Administrators operate at the direction of and as an extension 
of the Agency itself, those Program Administrators share all disciplinary action decisions with the 
Agency, and suspension from participation can be appealed to the IPA itself, who provides final 
determination on program status.  
In approving the Agency’s Initial Plan through Docket No. 17-0838, the Commission recognized the 
necessity for consumer protection requirements and authorized the Agency to develop requirements 
via  program-related  forms  and  documents  outside  of  the  Commission’s  approval  proceeding.  
Consistent with the Commission’s Order in that proceeding, the IPA developed initial consumer 
protection policies and procedures as terms and conditions of participation in these programs.  In 
order to ensure transparency in the development of these guidelines, the IPA and its Program 
Administrators held a series of stakeholder feedback sessions and solicited written stakeholder 
feedback  in  2018  before  producing  program  brochures,  standard  disclosure  forms,  contract 
requirements, requirements for marketing behavior and marketing materials, and the ABP Program 
Guidebook and ILSFA Approved Vendor Manual upon opening of the programs.   
After deliberation, the Agency decided not to seek Commission approval of those specific documents 
through approval of its Revised Plan in Docket 19-0995.   The Agency believed then that the ability 
to adjust such documents and the requirements embodied within them based on market experience, 
without  further  Commission  approval,  outweighed  the  certainty  associated  with  having  an 
administrative order from a quasi-adjudicatory body affirming the specific contents contained 
therein.  Instead, the Commission affirmed the following through its Order approving the Revised 
Plan:   
▪  The Agency maintains flexibility to adjust its program requirements, and the documents and 
forms  through  which  they  are  expressed,  without  further  Commission  approval  as 
warranted;  
▪  Any significant adjustments to those requirements should be preceded by a process to 
receive stakeholder feedback;  
 
574 See 83 Ill. Adm. Code Part 412 for administrative rules outlining those practices.

▪  The principle that Approved Vendors may be held accountable for the conduct of their agents, 
subcontractors, or designees under the Agency’s marketing guidelines and other program 
requirements  is  a  reasonable  requirement  consistent  with  a)  the  Commission’s 
determination in Docket No. 17-0838 and b) the Agency’s statutory authority to develop 
terms, conditions, and requirements applicable to the programs it implements.   
In accordance with the Commission’s Order in Docket 19-0995 approving the Revised Plan, the 
Adjustable Block Program Marketing Guidelines and related documents were updated through a 
stakeholder  process  to  reflect  changes  approved  by  the  Commission,  including  updating  the 
requirements  to  align  with  requirements  placed  on  alternative  retail  suppliers  through  the 
enactment of Public Act 101-0590.575  These requirements and related documents underwent minor 
modifications once again in October 2021 to reflect changes in program requirements surrounding 
the opening of additional capacity for the Adjustable Block Program on December 14, 2021.576 
9.2.  Consumer Protection Provisions Arising from Public Act 102-0662 
Changes in law under Public Act 102-0662 require the Agency, along with its Program Administrators 
for both the Adjustable Block Program and Illinois Solar for All Program, to propose various program 
terms, conditions, and requirements applicable to participating entities and project applications.  In 
large part, the requirements, codified at 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c)(1)(M), mirror consumer protections 
put into place by the Agency and approved by the Commission under the Initial and Revised Plans. 
Pursuant to the P.A. 102-0662, the Agency is required to: 
i.  Establish a registration process for entities seeking to qualify for program-administered 
incentive funding, maintain a list of such entities, and revoke an entity’s ability to receive 
funding based on the failure to comply with contract terms, the law, or other program 
requirements; 
ii.  Establish  program  requirements  and  minimum  contract  terms  to  ensure  projects  are 
properly installed and produce their expected amounts of energy; 
iii.  Direct  program  participants  and  their  agents  to  provide  standardized  disclosure  to  a 
customer prior to the customer’s execution of a contract in order to discourage deceptive 
marketing and bad faith business practices; 
iv.  Establish  Consumer  Complaint  Centers  to  accept  complaints  regarding  entities  that 
participate  in  or  otherwise  benefit  from  State-administered  incentive  funding  through 
Agency-administered programs, and maintain a public database of complaints; 
v.  Provide an annual written report to the Commission documenting the frequency and nature 
of complaints as well as any enforcement actions taken in response; 
vi.  Convene regular meetings with representatives of the Office of the Attorney General, the 
Commission,  consumer  protection  groups,  and  other  interested  stakeholders  to  share 
information regarding consumer protection, project compliance, and complaints received; 
and 
vii.  Refer complaints that implicate the jurisdiction of the Office of the Attorney General, the 
Commission, or local, State, or federal law enforcement to the appropriate entity as necessary.

As revisions to Section 1-75(c)(1)(M) now expressly state that the IPA “shall propose the Adjustable 
Block program terms, conditions, and requirements . . . through the development, review, and 
approval of the Agency's long-term renewable resources procurement plan,” the Agency understands 
this new language as a directive from the General Assembly to include these requirements within the 
Long-Term Plan, subject to approval from the Commission, where practicable to do so.577   
As noted in Section 9.1, the Agency lacks plenary regulatory authority over developers of distributed 
generation or community solar projects.  However, the changes in law to Section 1-75(c)(1)(M) 
pursuant to the enactment of Public Act 102-0662 reinforce the IPA’s understanding that consumer 
protections  are  a  vital  part  of  its  programs  through  new  express  statutory  requirements 
necessitating  that  the  Agency  develop  “terms,  conditions  and  requirements  for  program 
participation” that discourage deceptive marketing practices and bad faith business practices.  A 
description of the Agency’s requirements for both programs and proposed changes thereto are 
outlined below; existing and proposed new consumer protection program materials are contained 
within Appendix I to this Plan.  Consistent with past practice, the Agency sought the approval of the 
underlying requirements while retaining the flexibility to modify these materials as needed. Material 
or significant modifications to these requirements between approval of this and future iterations of 
the Long-Term Plan would be conducted through a stakeholder feedback process (except in the case 
of emergency changes, such as the type necessitated by the COVID-19 global health pandemic). The 
Commission approved this approach in its Final Order in ICC Docket No. 22-0231. The Commission 
affirmed “the IPA’s ability to make modifications” between Plan proceedings and rejected the 
argument that “every modification, no matter how minor, must be vetted through the stakeholder 
process.”578  
Appendix I-1 to this Plan includes the Consumer Protection Handbook and ABP and ILSFA Contract 
Requirements, which have been updated from the versions filed on March 21, 2022 to reflect the 
Final Order in Docket No. 22-0231. Consistent with this Plan and past approved practice, Approved 
Vendors  and Designees are  given  45  days  of  lead  time  to  become  fully  compliant  with  new 
requirements in these documents. Compliance is therefore required by August 28, 2022, 45 days 
after the Commission’s July 14, 2022 Final Order. Appendix I-2 to this Plan includes the Disclosure 
Forms, which have not yet gone into effect. The Agency intends to hold a stakeholder feedback 
process to further update these forms, and expects to launch the final updated Disclosure Forms 
through the online Program portals for the June 1, 2023 start of the next Program years.  
9.3.  Registration for Program Participants 
The Agency is required to establish a registration process for entities that wish to qualify for 
program-administered incentive funding, establish baseline qualifications for approval of these 
entities, and maintain a list on each program’s website.  Additionally, the Agency may revoke the 
ability for these registered entities to receive program-administered incentive funding upon a 
 
577 The Agency does not interpret this provision of the IPA Act to allow it to promulgate administrative rules related to terms and conditions 
of program participation.  While the Administrative Procedure Act applies to all its administrative rules and procedures (20 ILCS 3855/1-
30.1), the Agency “shall not adopt any rules that infringe upon the authority granted to the Commission” under Section 1-35 of the IPA Act.  
As the Commission has the authority to approve this Long-Term Plan under Section 1-75(c)(1)(A) of the IPA Act and Section 16-111.5(b)(5) 
of the PUA, the Agency cannot adopt any administrative rules regarding the terms, conditions, and requirements for participation in the 
Adjustable Block and Illinois Solar for All Programs under Section 1-75(c)(1)(M) of the IPA Act – or, indeed, for any other requirement 
related to the programs. The promulgation of such administrative rules would plainly infringe upon the authority granted to the 
Commission through its role reviewing and approving the Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan.

determination that the entity failed to comply with program requirements or the law.  While these 
statutory requirements are newly-enacted pursuant to P.A. 102-0662, those provisions hew closely 
to the requirements already in place under both programs, as detailed below.  
9.3.1.  Registration Requirements 
Registration requirements for Approved Vendors and Designees under the Adjustable Block Program 
are laid out in Sections 7.7 and 7.8 of this Plan, respectively, and further detail on those processes is 
contained within the Program Guidebook.  Approved Vendors seeking to participate in the Illinois 
Solar for All Program must first satisfy the requirement of being an Approved Vendor in good 
standing with the Adjustable Block Program.  Registration requirements for Approved Vendors 
under the Illinois Solar for All Program are laid out in Section 8.9 of this Plan, and further detail on 
the Approved Vendor application process and Designee registration process is contained within the 
program’s Approved Vendor Manual. 
The Agency experienced an increased number of complaints within the Adjustable Block Program in 
2021,  predominately  surrounding  actions  of  Designees  rather  than  Approved  Vendors.  
Investigations into these complaints have shown that more often than not, Approved Vendors are 
unaware of their Designees’ violative conduct.  The Agency previously sought stakeholder feedback 
on whether Designees in the Adjustable Block Program should be subject to an application process 
similar to Approved Vendors (as opposed to the current process, where Designees simply register 
with the program rather than applying to the program seeking the ability to participate as an 
Approved Vendor does).  The Agency received feedback indicating that this proposal was not 
supported, as the process would be burdensome to Designees and may create barriers to program 
participation for new and emerging businesses.  
Instead, the Agency will require that Approved Vendors that utilize Designees develop plans and 
processes for the vetting, management, and training of their Designees.  As the Approved Vendor is 
ultimately responsible for the actions of its Designees, the Agency believes that this will ensure that 
both Approved Vendors and Designees are well-informed of the requirements of the Consumer 
Protection Handbook (outlined in Section 9.4.1) and other relevant program documents, and that 
this in turn may help reduce the volume and type of consumer complaints, ultimately leading to 
greater success both in individual projects and the programs overall.  Approved Vendors will be 
required to submit these plans and process to the Agency and/or Program Administrators upon 
request and may be subject to disciplinary action for the failure to develop and implement internal 
policies and procedures for the management of Designees.579  
The Agency will also require that Designees go through an annual process to renew their registration, 
similar to the current renewal process for Approved Vendors. As part of this process, Designees will 
submit their training materials and certifications showing that their agents have been trained in 
accordance with program requirements.  
9.3.2.  Listing of Approved Entities 
Both the Adjustable Block Program and Illinois Solar for All Program provide lists of Approved 
Vendors  and  Designees  on  each  program’s  website.    For  the  Adjustable  Block  Program,  this 
 
579 The Agency notes that it intends to develop additional details regarding the requirements for Designee management plans through a 
stakeholder process and incorporate these requirements into the next version of the Consumer Protection Handbook.

information is published both on the consumer-facing branded website, Illinois Shines, and the 
website  designed  for  participating  entities.    Both  of  these  websites  also  provide  information 
regarding whether the entity has been disciplined by the Program Administrator for violations of 
program requirements.  The Illinois Solar for All website likewise provides a listing of Approved 
Vendors and registered Designees on its website; however, no disciplinary actions have been taken 
against Approved Vendors or Designees in that program to date.580  For more information on the 
public database of disciplinary actions and customer complaints, see Section 9.6 of this Plan. 
9.3.3.  Disciplinary Determinations 
The  Adjustable  Block  Program  and  the  Illinois  Solar  for  All  Program  are  ultimately  state-
administered incentive programs leveraging state- or utility-collected funds to provide additional 
incentives for photovoltaic project development.  These programs do not constitute the Illinois solar 
market generally; an Approved Vendor, agent, or Designee could simply choose to operate outside of 
the  Agency’s  consumer  protection  requirements  by  not  benefitting  from  incentive  funding.  
Consequently, the Agency’s disciplinary determinations are simply determining ongoing eligibility 
for state-administered incentives.  No general conduct is being restricted through the suspension or 
revocation of Approved Vendor status; all that is being restricted is an Approved Vendor’s eligibility 
for incentive funding through the Agency’s incentive programs.        
Changes in law through Public Act 102-0662 support the Agency’s prior position on disciplinary 
determinations for violations of program requirements.  Section 1-75(c)(1)(M)(i) now provides that 
the Agency may “revoke a vendor’s ability to receive program-administered incentive funding status 
upon a determination that the vendor failed to comply with contract terms, the law, or other program 
requirements.”  The Agency believes that revocation of the ability to receive incentive funding may 
involve Approved Vendors as direct recipients of incentive funding as well as Designees as indirect 
recipients or beneficiaries of that funding.  Additionally, the Agency believes that a reasonable 
interpretation of the changes in law would include both a temporary revocation (i.e., suspension) and 
permanent revocation (i.e., termination of program registration) of the ability to receive program-
administered incentive funding. 
The Agency appreciates that certain procedural safeguards should accompany its disciplinary 
determinations.  Through its Revised Plan, the Agency proposed (and the Commission approved) 
procedural requirements applicable to such determinations.  Specifically, mirroring and expanding 
on the process found in the Adjustable Block Program Guidebook, the Agency’s Revised Long-Term 
Plan provided that Approved Vendors, Designees, agents, or other third parties potentially subject to 
program discipline for a violation of program requirements generally be afforded the following:   
▪  A 45 calendar day lead time will be provided to Approved Vendors and Designees in order to 
prepare for and implement general changes to consumer protection requirements.  Unless 
otherwise specified, the lead time granted will not prohibit Approved Vendors and Designees 
from taking earlier steps towards compliance.  In situations where the Agency determines 
that emergency adoption of a new or modified consumer protection is necessary, no lead time 
 
580 The ILSFA Program Administrator has only sent one suspension letter to date, and it was to an entity that was not registered as an ILSFA 
Approved Vendor or Designee. On August 3, 2022, the ILSFA Program Administrator suspended an entity that had misrepresented the 
availability of ILSFA incentives to a customer and completed the project in a manner that made it ineligible for ILSFA.

will apply; however, the Agency commits to enforce any such requirements with an eye 
toward the practical challenges inherent in immediate implementation.581  
▪  In the event that the Program Administrator believes an Approved Vendor, Designee, or other 
entity participating in its programs is not acting, or has not acted, in compliance with program 
requirements, the appropriate Program Administrator will notify the participating entity 
(and its Approved Vendor, in the case of an agent or Designee) through an e-mail that:   
o  Outlines the problematic behavior;   
o  Explains how the behavior is non-compliant with program requirements;  
o  Requests more information about the issue; and   
o  Provides information on any penalties that might result from the behavior.582  
▪  With  the  limited  exception  of  emergency  situations  requiring  immediate  action  (as 
determined  at  the  discretion  of  the  IPA),  no  disciplinary  determination  (such  as  the 
suspension or revocation of the ability to participate in the Agency’s programs) will be made 
by the appropriate Program Administrator without the allegedly offending party having the 
opportunity to offer a written or oral explanation of the problematic behavior for review and 
analysis by the Program Administrator.  
▪  All disciplinary determinations are made by the Program Administrator in consultation with 
the Agency and will be communicated through a written explanation of the determination 
with at least the following:  
o  A  brief  explanation  of  the  infractions  for  which  the  Approved  Vendor  and/or 
Designee is being disciplined;  
o  A  timeline  of  communications  between  the  offending  entity  and  the  Program 
Administrator;   
o  Specific reference to which specific program requirement(s) the offending entity 
violated;  
o  In the case of a warning, an explanation of the concerning behavior that, if continued, 
may lead to a suspension from the program and/or other conditions that the entity 
may be required to satisfy to ensure compliance with Program requirements; 
o  In the case of a probation, an explanation of the probation terms, including which 
program requirement(s) must be explicitly followed during the probation period, the 
penalty for failure to strictly comply during that period, and other conditions that the 
entity may be required to satisfy prior to the probation being lifted; 
o  In the case of a suspension, an explanation of the suspension terms, including what 
specific conduct is no longer permitted in connection with the Program through the 
length of the suspension and other conditions that the entity may be required to 
satisfy prior to resuming participation in the program;  and 
o  An explanation for how to appeal the Program Administrator’s determination that a 
suspension is warranted to the Agency and the deadline for submission of the appeal.  
Unless otherwise indicated, appeals must be submitted to the IPA within two weeks 
of the suspension determination, but that deadline may be extended by the IPA upon 
request by the disciplined entity for good cause.

▪  The IPA will endeavor to address any appeals of disciplinary determinations within two 
weeks  of  receiving  an  appeal  (although  the  need  to  receive  additional  documents  or 
information may extend that timeline).  The Consumer Protection Handbook clarifies that an 
appealing Approved Vendor or Designee may submit a request to the Agency for a stay of any 
disciplinary action pending a resolution of its appeal. The Agency may grant or deny this 
request and will consider, among other factors, the likelihood of customer harm from such a 
stay, whether the conduct that resulted in the suspension is ongoing, and the likelihood that 
the appealing entity may prevail. As part of its appeal, an Approved Vendor may also suggest 
alternative resolutions or means to address violations (other than the disciplinary action that 
is being appealed). 
▪  Any appeal determination made by the IPA will include, at minimum, a clear statement of the 
Agency’s decision, the consequences of that decision, and a supporting explanation as to why 
that decision was made.   
The Agency plans to develop additional guidelines to ensure that, as the Programs continue to expand 
and address a growing number of complaints, disciplinary responses continue to be carried out in a 
fair and consistent manner.  Using a transparent stakeholder feedback process, the Agency plans to 
develop a matrix583 laying out the types of consumer protection issues and program violations that 
have arisen or may arise and progressive disciplinary responses, including the process provided to 
the alleged offender and whether an appeal is available.584   
The Agency does not believe that the authority to “revoke a vendor’s ability to receive program-
administered funding status” is the same as authority to revoke a vendor’s ability to receive program-
administered funding—such as through the suspension of REC delivery contract payments—which 
the  counterparty  utility  is  contractually  obligated  to  provide  for  REC  deliveries,  unless  that 
consequence follows as a violation of certain REC delivery contract terms.   
9.4.  Program Requirements and Contract Requirements  
As discussed in Section 9.1, pursuant to the Commission’s Order approving the Initial Plan in Docket 
No.  17-0838,  the  Agency  and  its  Program  Administrators  developed  program  requirements, 
including marketing requirements, standard disclosure forms, contract requirements, and program 
brochures.  The Agency is now required under Section 1-75(c)(1)(M)(ii) to establish program 
requirements and minimum contract terms “to ensure projects are properly installed and produce 
their expected amounts of energy.” 
 
While the Agency sought approval of program requirements in the past through the Long-Term Plan, 
the actual content has been developed outside of the Plan approval process.  The Agency continues 
to believe that the ability to adjust consumer protection program requirements, including marketing 
requirements and contract requirements, based upon observations of the market and complaints 
regarding customer experiences is necessary to provide adequate consumer protections that can 
readily adapt to changes in the marketplace or other conditions.  For example, in March 2020, the 
 
583 New Jersey’s Clean Energy Program uses a similar approach to address issues with contractors violating program requirements. See 
Order at p.7, In the Matter of the Clean Energy Programs and Budget for Fiscal Year 2017: Contractor Remediation Procedures, N.J. Bd of Pub.

8C.pdf.  
584 The Agency initially expected that this stakeholder feedback process would commence in September 2022; the Agency now plans to 
begin stakeholder discussions on this topic in the October or November meetings of the Consumer Protection Working Group.

Agency issued emergency requirements related to in-person marketing during the onset of the 
COVID-19 global health pandemic.585  These emergency provisions were modified as the pandemic 
progressed through 2020, 2021, and into 2022.   
 
Documents outlining marketing requirements586 and other requirements have now been included 
with  this  Plan  as  directed  by  Section  1-75(c)(1)(M).  The  IPA  once  again  requested  that  the 
Commission affirm through approval of this Plan that the Agency maintains the flexibility to adjust 
the Adjustable Block Program and Illinois Solar for All consumer protection program requirements 
(including related documents and forms) between various iterations of the Long-Term Plan without 
further Commission approval.  As with the updates to the consumer protection requirements that 
arose from the Commission’s approval of the Revised Long-Term Plan in Docket No. 19-0995, the IPA 
commits  to  conducting  a  stakeholder  feedback  process  prior  to  implementing  significant 
adjustments  to  those  requirements  and  related  documents  between  plan  proceedings.    The 
Commission  approved  this  approach  in  the  Final  Order  in  Docket  No.  22-0231.587    The 
commencement of any such revision process will be announced on the respective program website 
and communicated to Approved Vendors, registered Designees, and other interested stakeholders.  
Following  a  significant,  non-emergency  change  in  program  requirements  adopted  through  a 
stakeholder process, program participants will have 45 calendar days to comply with the updated 
provisions.  
9.4.1.  Consumer Protection Handbook 
Appended to this 2022 Long-Term Plan in Appendix I-1, the Agency provides a new document, the 
Consumer  Protection  Handbook,  which  updates  and  consolidates  the  ABP  Community  Solar 
Marketing Guidelines and Distributed Generation Marketing Guidelines, as well as the ILSFA Low-
Income Community Solar Consumer Protection Requirements and the Low-Income Distributed 
Generation Consumer Protection Requirements.  Approved Vendors and Designees in both programs 
are required to adhere to the Consumer Protection Handbook (“CP Handbook”).   
There was considerable overlap in the requirements in each of the documents previously in use, but 
also some important differences, requiring Approved Vendors and Designees that offered multiple 
types of projects to read each separate applicable document in full and keep track of differences 
between them. The Agency believes that a consolidated CP Handbook that highlights differences 
between ABP and ILSFA, and between community solar and distributed generation projects, will be 
more useful to Approved Vendors and Designees, especially those who offer multiple types of 
projects or subscriptions. The Agency also believes a consolidated handbook is consistent with the 
legislative directive to implement ILSFA “in a manner that seeks to . . . maximize efficiencies and 
synergies available through coordination with similar initiatives, including the Adjustable Block 
program.” 20 ILCS 3855/1-56(b)(2).  
The CP Handbook reflects significant formatting changes, organizational updates, and clarifications, 
but retains most of the same substantive requirements. For example, to reduce redundancy, unlike 
the ABP DG and Community Solar Marketing Guidelines, the document is not separated into

marketing “materials” and marketing “activities.”  The final CP Handbook, modified consistent with 
the Commission’s Final Order in Docket No. 22-0231, is attached to this Plan in Appendix I-1.  While 
the creation of a red-lined version of the CP Handbook was impractical due to the nature and extent 
of the changes, the Agency posted a copy of the CP Handbook to its website which includes comments 
in the margins of the CP Handbook flagging major changes in substantive requirements between the 
previous documents (ABP Community Solar and Distributed Generation Marketing Guidelines, and 
ILSFA  Low-Income  Community  Solar  and  Distributed  Generation  Consumer  Protection 
Requirements) and the initial draft CP Handbook filed on March 21, 2022. Approved Vendors and 
Designees should not rely exclusively on these comments and should review the new document in 
full.  
The CP Handbook includes several new requirements, clarified requirements, and provisions that 
explicitly lay out existing requirements, including but not limited to: 
•  Explanations of what would make an act or practice unfair or abusive 
•  A requirement that Approved Vendors and Designees be responsive to customer questions 
and concerns and respond as promptly as possible, but no later than within seven business 
days 
•  Requirements regarding compliance with contractual obligations, conducting business in a 
professional manner, and providing services in a workmanlike manner  
•  Requirements regarding cooperation with investigations and truthfulness to the Program 
Administrator and Agency 
•  Required disclosures for all marketing channels 
•  Required disclosures and record retention requirements for telemarketing 
•  Requirement that the relevant utility account holder must be the signatory on the Disclosure 
Form (or, if the if the account holder is a company or organization, an individual authorized 
to sign on behalf of the account holder) 
•  Requirements regarding the use of third-party commercially available e-signature platforms 
•  Requirements regarding how Disclosure Forms should be completed  
The Agency has seen a rise in the number of complaints from customers regarding additional or 
increased payments that are scheduled to begin before the customer receives an anticipated pass-
through of the state-administered incentives under the REC delivery contract. The CP Handbook 
includes a new requirement that to address this issue. For DG contracts where the Approved Vendor 
will make a direct payment or payments to the customer to pass through some or all of the REC 
incentive payment, the CP Handbook requires the Approved Vendor to (1) invoice for the incentive 
payment in a timely fashion, (2) pay the incentive to the customer after receipt in a timely fashion, 
and (3) not use the customer’s share of the incentive payment to meet other financial obligations of 
the Approved Vendor. 
Chapter I of the CP Handbook sets out requirements for conducting business in a fair, honest, and 
legal manner, including requirements regarding statements about RECs and the nature of energy 
received,  statements  about  customer  savings  and  the  nature  of  offers,  representations  about 
marketers’ identity and affiliates, and use of testimonials. Chapter II provides requirements that 
apply regardless of the marketing channel.  
Chapter III then sets out additional requirements that apply to specific marketing channels, such as 
in-person sales or telemarketing. Chapter IV explains requirements for marketing to non-English

speakers. Chapter V discusses Disclosure Forms and the process for executing customer contracts. 
Approved Vendors must provide each customer with a completed Disclosure Form prior to the 
customer’s  execution  of  the  customer  contract.  Each  Disclosure  Form  will  have  the  relevant 
Informational Brochure attached as the first two pages. The brochures are available in either print 
or electronic form and have been prepared by the Program Administrator, approved by the Agency, 
and may not be modified by the Approved Vendor or Designee.  The brochure informs consumers of 
their rights, procedures for filing complaints, and point to more information on the Program website. 
The Agency has prepared the brochures in English and Spanish and will produce versions in 
additional language should the need arise. The Agency is also updating the Illinois Shines Timeline, 
which is required to be provided to ABP DG customers who are purchasing a system. The revised 
document is titled “Going Solar: Your Guide to Illinois Shines,” and is reworded and redesigned, while 
providing substantively the same information as the original timeline. One change in content is that 
the Going Solar flyer includes a link to the new project look-up tool, which allows customers to check 
the status of their DG project.588  
Chapter VI sets out substantive requirements for offers. Chapter VII explains requirements for sales 
agent training, and Chapter VIII discusses requirements related to bundled Alternative Retail Electric 
Suppliers offers. Chapter IX sets out recordkeeping requirements. Chapter X discusses complaint and 
disciplinary processes.  
Chapter XI sets out additional requirements that apply to ILSFA. The applicable requirements for the 
Illinois Solar for All Program include additional protections beyond those of the Adjustable Block 
Program, as to account for the additional risk of deceptive marketing practices and behaviors 
targeted towards low-income customers. 
Pursuant to the Commission’s Final Order in Docket No. 22-0231, the CP Handbook has been updated 
to clarify requirements around the use of the utility name in marketing,589 as well as to include the 
requirement that notices of potential violation to Approved Vendors and Designees must include 
information regarding possible penalties.590 This updated version of the CP Handbook is attached in 
Appendix I-1 and has been published on both Program websites.  
9.4.2.  ABP Program Requirements 
In addition to being outlined in this Plan, program requirements for participants in the Adjustable 
Block Program have also in the past been detailed in the Program Guidebook, Contract Requirements, 
and Guidelines591 for Marketing Materials and Marketing Behavior (“Marketing Guidelines”), of 
which there were separate versions for marketing of community solar subscriptions and distributed 
generation installations.  As explained above in Section 9.4.1, the Marketing Guidelines are among 
several documents now consolidated into the new Consumer Protection Handbook. Approved 
Vendors  and  Designees  alike  are  required  to  be  familiar  with  and  comply  with  all  program 
requirements in order to remain in good standing with the program.   
While Chapter 7 of this Plan outlines the primary goals and requirements for the Adjustable Block 
Program, detail regarding the implementation of those requirements is explained in the ABP Program

Guidebook.  Developed by the Agency in conjunction with the Program Administrator, the Program 
Guidebook provides necessary detail on program requirements across all program categories and 
processes.  As such, some items related to the consumer protection provisions in Public Act 102-0662 
(for example, the processes for Approved Vendor applications and Designee registration or project 
inspections)  are  outlined  in  the  Program  Guidebook.    The  Agency,  along  with  the  Program 
Administrator,  work  to  update  the  Program  Guidebook  on  a  regular  basis  to  ensure  that 
requirements are in step with the program as it develops.   
In addition to the Program Guidebook, there are several other documents that either set forth 
program requirements or are essential for compliance with those requirements, including: 
•  Distributed  Generation  Standard  Disclosure  Form:  available  in  English,  with  separate 
versions available dependent upon whether the system is leased, purchased, or financed 
through a PPA. Instead of a separate Disclosure Form for DG project over 25 kW in size, the 
streamlined,  uniform  form  for  each  financing  type—once  finalized—should  be  used 
regardless of project size. The new DG forms for lease, purchase, and PPA will be used for all 
ABP DG projects, regardless of size. The Agency plans to release Spanish versions of the 
Distributed Generation Disclosure Forms as soon as practicable.  
•  Community Solar Standard Disclosure Form: available in both English and Spanish. 
•  Informational Brochures:592 available in both English and Spanish, with separate brochures 
providing detail on distributed generation and community solar technologies and offers. 
•  Consumer Protection Handbook: updates and consolidates the previously used Guidelines for 
Marketing Materials and Marketing Behavior.  
•  Contract Requirements: different contract requirements exist for installation of a distributed 
generation system and a community solar subscription.593 
These supporting documents as listed above and attached hereto in Appendix I work in concert with 
the Program Guidebook to ensure that program participants (Approved Vendors and Designees) are 
fully informed on program requirements. Approved Vendors must document to the IPA through the 
application process that the minimum contract requirements for distributed generation systems 
were met (outlined below in Section 9.4.2.1), that the customer received the Informational Brochure, 
and that the customer received and executed a standard (i.e., unmodified) Disclosure Form prior to 
the execution of the contract with the program participant (as explained in more detail in Section 
9.5). 
 It is the Agency’s hope that through development of these requirements, customers who encounter 
the  Programs  are  educated  about  the  benefits  and  costs  of  photovoltaic  installation  and/or 
community  solar  subscriptions.    The  Agency  firmly  believes  that  a  well-informed  Approved 
Vendor/Designee can ensure that customers have a positive experience and understand both the 
program and their offer, so goes to great lengths to ensure Approved Vendors/Designees are well 
informed, while simultaneously maintaining a focus on consumer education and protection.

9.4.2.1.  ABP DG Contract Requirements 
The Initial Long-Term Plan stated that, for distributed generation installations, the Illinois Power 
Agency and its Program Administrator would develop “a list of contract requirements” to be provided 
to Approved Vendors for the system purchase contract, lease, or power purchase agreement (“PPA”) 
between the Approved Vendor (or its agent) and the customer.  After approval of the Initial Plan 
through Docket No. 17-0838, the Agency (through a stakeholder comment process) developed 
minimum  contract  requirements  applicable  to  photovoltaic  system  sales,  photovoltaic  system 
installations, and community solar subscriptions.  These contract requirements were developed and 
released for program participants on January 23, 2019, and have applied to transactions supported 
by the Program since the onset of the Adjustable Block Program. 
Public Act 102-0662’s changes to 1-75(c)(1)(M) reinforce the Agency’s authority for developing 
these requirements as a condition of participation in its incentive programs.  Specific minimum 
contract requirements are outlined in the subsections below.  To date, these requirements have 
generally taken the approach of a minimum set of items which need to be expressly addressed 
through the contract, rather than minimum baseline terms intended to benefit customers (such as 
customer savings requirements, O&M terms, PV system capacity factor/efficiency, etc.).   
The minimum requirements for installation contracts utilized for projects that participate the 
Adjustable Block Program are as follows:594 
1.  Common Contract Requirements for All Business Models 
•  Right of rescission within three or more calendar days (only for systems <=25kW)  
•  System design specification:  
i.  Site plan or equivalent drawing (this may be incorporated by reference, in 
which case the site plan or equivalent drawing must be completed and 
provided to the customer within 30 days of the contract execution and must 
be substantially consistent with the specifications contained in the contract 
and Disclosure Form) 
ii.  Size of system  
iii.  Estimated first year production and annual degradation  
•  If performance guarantee is provided:  
i.  Host or owner’s remedy in case of underperformance  
ii.  Host or owner’s procedure to lodge a claim under the performance guarantee  
•  Change in pricing or other terms, if any, in the event of non-selection for an Adjustable 
Block Program REC contract. As an example, a condition precedent clause would 
satisfy this requirement.  
•  Responsibility for interconnection application  
•  If warranty is provided:  
i.  Term of warranty  
ii.  Defects covered (e.g., faulty installation, malfunctioning components beyond 
manufacturer’s warranty, roof damage)  
iii.  Financial limits on warranty  
iv.  Warranty provider

The Agency proposed an adjustment to the “site plan or equivalent drawing” requirement. The 
Agency’s understanding is that site plans are often completed by an engineer after the installation 
contract is signed and that it may be burdensome to require the site plan to be completed prior to 
contract execution. Therefore, the Agency will allow Approved Vendors and Designees to incorporate 
the site plan or equivalent drawing in the contract by reference, as long as the site plan or drawing is 
completed and provided to the customer within 30 days and is substantially consistent with the 
system specifications in the contract and Disclosure Form. This will ensure that the customer is still 
provided with the site plan in a reasonably timely fashion and not subjected to a bait-and-switch.  
9.4.2.2.  Special Considerations for Community Solar 
Approved Vendors and Designees involved in acquiring subscribers for community solar projects 
receiving incentives under the Adjustable Block Program must adhere to the requirements set forth 
in the Consumer Protection Handbook, which incorporates requirements previously found in the 
Guidelines  for  Community  Solar  Marketing  Materials  and  Marketing  Behavior  (“CS  Marketing 
Guidelines”).  While a subscription to a community renewable generation project is not the same as 
the installation of a distributed generation system, it does bear similarities to taking supply service 
from Alternative Retail Electric Supplier.  
Based on ARES practices, the Agency recognizes that door to door, telemarketing, or online sales of 
community renewable generation subscriptions may be marketing channels of particular concern 
because of the information asymmetry between the salesperson and the consumer. The Agency 
believes an informed consumer is a wise consumer and strongly encourages marketing channels that 
respect the opportunity for consumers to have complete and accurate information about the 
decisions they may make regarding subscriptions, particularly those related to upfront payments, 
the net price of energy, and termination fees and conditions. The Agency and/or its Program

306,314,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
Administrators  may conduct  additional monitoring  of  Approved  Vendors  and  their  Designees 
(and/or their partners/affiliates) that utilize door to door, telemarketing, and online sales, and 
reserve the right to request the Approved Vendor or Designee provide additional documentation of 
those marketing channels including, but not limited to, access to call center recordings for either sales 
or third-party verifications. 
 
The CP Handbook sets out provisions for marketing community solar subscriptions, including 
requirements for providing documents to customers, the process for contract execution, sales agent 
training and recordkeeping, and complaint and disciplinary processes. Approved Vendors and 
Designees are unequivocally prohibited from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive business 
practices in their involvement with the programs. 
 
As described in the IPA’s Initial and Revised Plans, there are a number of state and federal consumer 
protection laws, regulations, and enforcement agencies that apply to all forms of marketing, including 
marketing of subscriptions to Community Renewable Generation Projects.595

These laws and regulations provide a starting point for protecting consumers, but their enforcement 
agencies typically only track and enforce violations if triggered by consumer complaints.  The Agency 
will collaborate with the Office of the Attorney General, the Commission, and law enforcement as 
applicable in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.8, below, to ensure compliance with these 
requirements.  The CP Handbook details the use of the standard disclosure forms, and further 
requirements surrounding the use of these forms are included below in Section 9.5.  Additionally, in 
order  to  ensure  that  subscribers  are  well-informed  and  thus  afforded  adequate  consumer 
protections, the Agency requires that all projects also adhere to the minimum contract requirements 
outlined in Section 9.4.2.3, below.  
9.4.2.3.  ABP CS Minimum Contract Requirements 
The Agency requires that Approved Vendors and/or their Designees seeking or receiving REC 
delivery contracts to support community solar projects through the Adjustable Block Program must 
include each of the following in any contracts entered into with subscribers: 
(a)  A plain language disclosure of the subscription, including:  
(i) The terms under which the pricing will be calculated over the life of the contract 
and a good faith estimate of the subscription price expressed as a monthly rate or on 
a per kilowatt-hour basis;  
(ii) Whether any charges may increase during the course of service, and, if so, how 
much advance notice is provided to the subscriber.  
(b)  Contract provisions regulating the disposition or transfer of a subscription;  
(c)  All nonrecurring (one-time) charges;  
(d)  All recurring (monthly, yearly) charges;  
(e) A statement of contract duration, including the initial time period and any rollover 
provision;  
(f) Terms and conditions for early termination, including:  
(i) Any penalties that the Project Developer may charge to the subscriber; and  
(ii) The process for unsubscribing and any associated costs.  
(g) If a security deposit is required:

308,316,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
(i) The amount of the security deposit;  
(ii) A description of when and under what circumstances the security deposit will be 
returned;  
(iii) A description of how the security deposit may be used; and  
(iv) A description of how the security deposit will be protected.  
(h) A description of any fee or charge and the circumstances under which a customer may 
incur a fee or charge;  
(i) A statement explaining any conditions under which the Project Developer may terminate 
the contract early, including:  
(i) Circumstances under which early cancellation by the Project Developer may occur;  
(ii) Manner in which the Project Developer shall notify the customer of the early 
cancellation of the contract;  
(iii) Duration of the notice period before early cancellation; and  
(iv) Remedies available to the customer if early cancellation occurs;  
(j) A statement that the customer may terminate the contract early, including:  
(i) Amount of any early cancellation fee;  
(k) A statement describing contract renewal procedures, if any, including any automatic 
renewal provisions;  
(l) A dispute procedure;  
(m) The Agency’s and Commission’s phone number and Internet address;  
(n) A billing procedure description;  
(o) The data privacy policies of the Project Developer;  
(p) A description of any compensation to be paid for underperformance;  
(q) Evidence of insurance;  
(r) A description of the project’s long-term maintenance plan;  
(s) Current production projections and a description of the methodology used to develop 
production projections;  
(t) Contact information for the Project Developer for questions and complaints;  
(u) A statement that the Project Developer does not make representations or warranties 
concerning the tax implications of any bill credits provided to the subscriber;  
(v) The method of providing notice to the subscribers when the project is out of service for 
more than three business days, including notice of:  
(i) The estimated duration of the outage; and  
(ii) The estimated production that will be lost due to the outage. 
 (w) Any other terms and conditions of service.  
 
In addition, to ensure portability and transferability of subscription contracts, as required by Section 
1-75(c)(1)(N) of the Act, any such contract should provide that the subscriber (i) may retain the 
subscription (or at least a downsized version of the subscription relative to the subscriber’s new 
load) as long as the subscriber changes addresses for utility service within the same utility service 
territory, and (ii) may assign or sell the subscription to another person within the same utility service 
territory, without any fee owed to the subscription counterparty, subject to reasonable terms and 
conditions including matching the subscription size to the new subscriber’s load.  Section 1-
75(c)(1)(N)  states  that  requirements  that  community  solar  subscriptions  be  “portable  and 
“transferable” can be “[s]ubject to reasonable limitations,” and the Agency believes this approach fits

that standard.  The Agency understands that the community renewable net metering tariffs for 
Ameren Illinois and ComEd approved by the Commission are consistent with these principles.596 
9.4.3.  ILSFA Program Requirements 
Like the Adjustable Block Program, Illinois Solar for All Program requirements are outlined in this 
Plan and through additional documents developed by the Agency and the Program Administrator to 
facilitate the administration of the program.  Program requirements for participants in ILSFA are laid 
out in Chapter 8 of this Plan and detailed in the Approved Vendor Manual (“AV Manual”), customer 
contract provisions for both low-income community solar and low-income distributed generation 
sub-programs,  and  the  Consumer  Protection  Handbook  (“CP  Handbook”),  which  incorporates 
requirements previously set out in the Consumer Protection Guidelines for Low-Income Distributed 
Generation and Low-Income Community Solar.  Approved Vendors and Designees alike are required 
to be familiar with and comply with all program requirements in order to remain in good standing 
with the program.   
While Chapter 8 of this Plan outlines the primary goals and requirements for ILSFA, detail regarding 
the implementation of those requirements is explained in the AV Manual, which provides necessary 
detail on program requirements across all program categories and processes.  As such, some items 
related to the consumer protection provisions in Public Act 102-0662 (for example, the processes for 
Approved Vendor applications, Designee registrations, and project inspections) are outlined in the 
AV Manual.  The Agency, along with the Program Administrator, works to update the AV Manual on 
a regular basis to ensure that requirements are in step with the program as it develops.  Most 
recently, the AV Manual was updated in April of 2021 to outline program requirements for the 2021-
2022 program year. 
When discussing consumer protection program requirements applicable to the ILSFA program, it is 
important to consider the communities that the program was designed to serve.  Low-income 
communities have been historically underserved by programs that offer resources and incentives for 
energy, housing, and access to capital, and as a result have had very low participation in the clean 
energy economy generally.  This low participation level has created a significant information gap 
within such communities.  At the same time, low-income communities have often been targeted with 
false  or  deceptive  marketing  practices,  predatory  sales,  unfair  contracts,  and  low-quality 
workmanship.  The requirements for consumer protections within the Illinois Solar for All Program 
are designed to address these realities. 
In addition to the AV Manual, there are several other documents necessary to the topic of consumer 
protections within ILSFA, as they set forth program requirements or are essential for compliance 
with those requirements, including: 
•  CP  Handbook  (found  in  Appendix  I-1  to  this  Plan),  which  incorporates  requirements 
previously found in Consumer Protections for Low-Income Distributed Generation and 
Consumer Protections for Low-Income Community Solar 
 
596 As noted in Section 7.9.6.3, both Ameren Illinois and Commonwealth Edison currently have tariffs related to community solar net 
metering open before the Commission; neither utility has proposed to change the portability and transferability provisions of its tariffs.

•  Program brochures, available in both English and Spanish, for the following subcategories: 
Low-Income Distributed Generation,597 Low-Income Community Solar,598 and Non-Profits 
and Public Facilities599 
•  Contract Requirements – minimum contract terms for both distributed generation and 
community solar technologies 
•  Standard Disclosure Forms, some of which are currently available in both English and 
Spanish, for the various distributed generation forms, differentiated by financing type, as well 
as for community solar; instead of a separate Disclosure Form for Non-Profit/Public Facility 
projects, the Agency will require that the new streamlined, uniform forms for each financing 
type—once finalized—be used regardless of project size.     
The supporting documents as listed above and attached hereto in Appendices I-1 and I-2 work in 
concert with the AV Manual to ensure that program participants (Approved Vendors and Designees) 
are aware of all program requirements.  These documents were developed and informed in part by 
the  program  requirements  for  the  Adjustable  Block  Program  and  include  specific  additional 
requirements to ensure protections for higher-risk communities that are served by the Illinois Solar 
for All Program.  It is the Agency’s hope that through development of these requirements, customers 
who encounter the program are educated about the benefits and costs of photovoltaic installation 
and/or community solar subscriptions.  The Agency firmly believes that a well-informed Approved 
Vendor/Designee can ensure that customers have a positive experience and understand the program 
and their offer, so goes to great lengths to ensure Approved Vendors/Designees are well informed, 
while simultaneously maintaining a focus on consumer education and protection.   
9.4.3.1.  ILSFA DG and NP/NF Contract Requirements 
The Illinois Solar for All Program provides incentives to low-income customers and communities and 
therefore includes a set of considerations around minimum contract requirements that is different 
from the Adjustable Block Program to provide additional protections and guarantees for more 
vulnerable populations. For the Illinois Solar for All Program, the Agency requires that Approved 
Vendors seeking REC delivery contracts associated with the Low-Income Single-Family and Small 
Multifamily Solar Incentive, the Low-Income Large Multifamily Solar Incentive, and the Incentives for 
Non-Profits and Public Facilities must include each of the following in any contracts entered into with 
participants: 600 
•  Contract must be in the language requested by the customer.  
•  1-4 unit Low-income Distributed Generation customers cannot be required to provide an 
upfront payment prior to energization.  
•  Once energization begins, any ongoing payments (on an annualized basis) by customer 
cannot exceed 50% of expected first-year net metering value. This requirement applies to 
two distinct time periods: (1) the first year of the contract as well as (2) a calculated annual 
average for (a) the life of the customer’s contract or (b), in the case of a purchase transaction 
or a lease/PPA with a buyout option, a 25-year period. For these calculations, the following 
assumptions must hold:

o  A standard annual production degradation rate of 0.5% must be used;  
o  An annual energy price escalation rate of up to 1.7% can be used;  
o  The annual customer payment rate escalation cannot exceed the energy escalation 
rate used.  
o  For Low-Income Distributed Generation projects, the first-year net metering value 
used in the savings calculation must be based on either (i) the rate listed on the 
Disclosure form, or (ii) an average of the customer’s 12 most recent monthly bills.  
o  For Non-profit/Public Facility projects, the first-year net metering value used in the 
savings calculation must be based on an average of 12 consecutive months of 
customer bills within the last two years.   
•  Full system warranty, as well as operations and maintenance guarantees for the duration of 
the REC Contract or 15 years, at no additional cost to participants.  
•  Financing amounts, terms, and conditions for a purchase or lease of a system must be based 
on an assessment of the Program participant’s ability to repay the debt, as defined by 
Regulation Z, which is a federal rule that implements aspects of the Truth in Lending Act and 
the Dodd-Frank Act.601  
•  Right of rescission within fourteen602 business days after contract execution (only for Low-
Income Distributed Generation; not for Non-profits/Public Facilities)  
•  System design specification:  
•  Site plan or equivalent drawing (this may be incorporated by reference, in which case 
the site plan or equivalent drawing must be completed and provided to the customer 
within 30 days of the contract execution and must be substantially consistent with 
the specifications contained in the contract and Disclosure Form) 
o  Size of system  
o  Type of panels  
o  Estimated first year production and annual degradation  
•  Change in pricing or other terms, if any, in the event of non-selection for an ILSFA REC 
contract. As an example, a condition precedent clause would satisfy this requirement.  
•  Allocation of responsibility for securing municipal permits and approvals  
•  Installer will be responsible for completing interconnection application if customer requests 
it.  
•  Allocation of responsibility for harm to property, materials, and workers during construction  
•  Installer commits to not pass on any costs related to curing problems found in project 
inspections conducted by the Illinois Power Agency or its designees.  
•  Installer commits to provide name of any subcontractor to customer before work begins.  
•  Requirement that any change order, including scope and price, must be confirmed in writing  
•  Allocation of responsibility for entering meter data (This provision could be in a separate 
contract.)  
•  All possible fees (other than those mentioned in the requirements for particular business 
types)

of the Disclosure Form to an ILSFA DG customer and the signing of the installation contract, and (2) extend the rescission period from 
seven to fourteen days. Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 127.

As with the ABP Distributed Generation Contract Requirements, the Agency also proposed an 
adjustment to the “site plan or equivalent drawing” requirement. The Agency’s understanding is that 
site plans are often completed by an engineer after the installation contract is signed and that it may 
be burdensome to require the site plan to be completed prior to contract execution. Therefore, the 
Agency will allow Approved Vendors and Designees to incorporate the site plan or equivalent 
drawing in the contract by reference, as long as the site plan or drawing is completed and provided 
to the customer within 30 days and is substantially consistent with the system specifications in the 
contract and Disclosure Form. This will ensure that the customer is still provided with the site plan 
in a reasonably timely fashion and not subjected to a bait-and-switch.  
9.4.3.2.  ILSFA LICS Contract Requirements 
Similar to the additional considerations for low-income distributed generation projects, the Agency 
requires  that  Approved  Vendors  seeking  REC  delivery  contracts  associated  with  Community 
Renewable Generation Facilities participating in the Illinois Solar for All Program must include each 
of the following in any contracts entered into with subscribers.603 The requirements regarding 
security deposits (formerly in section (g)) have been eliminated, as no upfront payments are 
permitted under ILSFA. 
(a) A plain language disclosure of the subscription, including:  
(i) The terms under which the pricing will be calculated over the life of the contract 
and a good faith estimate of the subscription price expressed as a monthly rate or on 
a per kilowatt-hour basis;  
(ii) Whether any charges may increase during the course of service, and, if so, how 
much advance notice is provided to the subscriber.  
(b) Contract provisions regulating the disposition or transfer of a subscription, as well as the 
costs or potential costs associated with such a disposition or transfer;  
(c) All nonrecurring (one-time) charges;  
(d) All recurring (monthly, yearly) charges;  
(e) A statement of contract duration, including the initial time period and any rollover 
provision;  
(f) Terms and conditions for early termination, including:  
(i) Any penalties that the Project Developer may charge to the subscriber; and  
(ii) The process for unsubscribing and any associated costs.  
(g) A description of any fee or charge and the circumstances under which a customer may 
incur a fee or charge;  
(h) A statement explaining any conditions under which the Project Developer may terminate 
the contract early, including:  
(i) Circumstances under which early cancellation by the Project Developer may occur;  
 
603 These requirements also apply to Designees managing community solar subscriptions for an Approved Vendor.

cancellation of the contract;  
(iii) Duration of the notice period before early cancellation; and  
(iv) Remedies available to the customer if early cancellation occurs;  
(i) A statement that the customer may terminate the contract early, including:  
(i) Amount of any early cancellation fee;  
(j) A statement describing contract renewal procedures, if any;  
(k) A dispute procedure;  
(l) The Agency’s and Commission’s phone number and Internet address;  
(m) A billing procedure description;  
(n) The data privacy policies of the Project Developer;  
(o) A description of any compensation to be paid for underperformance;  
(p) Evidence of insurance;  
(q) A description of the project’s long-term maintenance plan;  
(r) Current production projections and a description of the methodology used to develop 
production projections;  
(s) Contact information for the Project Developer for questions and complaints;  
(t) A statement that the Project Developer does not make representations or warranties 
concerning the tax implications of any bill credits provided to the subscriber;  
(u) The method of providing notice to the subscribers when the project is out of service for 
more than three business days, including notice of:  
(i) The estimated duration of the outage; and  
(ii) The estimated production that will be lost due to the outage.  
(v) Any other terms and conditions of service.  
(w) Once energization begins, any ongoing subscription payments (on an annualized basis) 
by customer cannot exceed 50% of expected first-year net metering value. This requirement 
applies to two distinct time periods: (1) the first year of the contract as well as (2) a calculated 
annual average for (i) the life of the customer’s subscription contract or (ii) in the case of a 
system share purchase, for 25 years. For these calculations, the following assumptions must 
hold:  
o  A standard annual production degradation rate of 0.5% must be used;  
o  An annual energy price escalation rate of up to 1.7% can be used;  
o  The  annual  customer  payment  rate  escalation  cannot  exceed  the  energy 
escalation rate used.  
o  The first-year net metering value used in the savings calculation must be based 
on either (i) an average statewide supply rate of $0.06 per kilowatt-hour or (ii) an 
average of the customer’s 12 most recent monthly utility bills.  
(x) The contract must be in the language requested by the customer.  
(y) Financing amounts, terms, and conditions for a purchase of a system share or a lease-
based subscription must be based on an assessment of the program participant’s ability to 
repay the debt, as defined by Regulation Z, which is a federal rule that implements aspects of 
the Truth in Lending Act and the Dodd-Frank Act.604 
(z) Right of rescission within three days after contract execution  
(aa) The subscriber cannot be required to provide an upfront payment prior to energization.

allowed.  
(cc) For situations where a low-income residential customer is taking a loan to finance 
purchase of particular panels or a share of the community solar project from a lender 
affiliated with an Approved Vendor:  
o  Financial instrument must include forbearance terms.  
▪  Forbearance terms must encompass one of the following:  
• Suspension of total payments for up to 3 months; or  
• Suspension of interest payments for up to 6 months; or 
• Reduction of interest payments for up to 12 months  
▪  Missed revenues may be recovered later in the contract life, but no interest may be 
applied.  
o  Loan may not be secured by home or home equity  
o  Loan documents must indicate the following:  
▪  Principal loan amount  
▪  Schedule of loan disbursements  
▪  Schedule and due dates of repayments  
▪  Order of allocating payments (to principal, interest, fees, etc.)  
▪  Interest rate  
▪  Borrower(s), lender, servicer  
▪  Nature of lender’s security interest (e.g., UCC-1 financing statement)  
▪  Events of default and lender’s remed(ies) upon default (including forbearance as 
discussed above)  
▪  All fees and penalties  
 
In addition, to ensure portability and transferability of subscription contracts, as required by Section 
1-75(c)(1)(N) of the Act, any such contract should provide that the subscriber (i) may retain the 
subscription (or at least a downsized version of the subscription relative to the subscriber’s new 
load) as long as the subscriber changes addresses for utility service within the same utility service 
territory, and (ii) may assign or sell the subscription to another person within the same utility service 
territory, without any fee owed to the subscription counterparty, subject to reasonable terms and 
conditions including matching the subscription size to the new subscriber’s load.  The Agency 
understands that the community renewable net metering tariffs for Ameren Illinois and ComEd 
approved by the Commission are consistent with these principles.605  
9.5.  Standard Disclosure Form Requirements 
Since the inception of the Adjustable Block and Illinois Solar for All Programs, the Agency has 
required that standard disclosure forms be provided to customers for their signature, with those 
customer-executed forms then submitted to the appropriate Program Administrator.  The customer 
must sign their completed Disclosure Form prior to signing their contract.  In its Order approving the 
Agency’s Revised Long-Term Plan, the Commission provided analysis reinforcing the requirement 
that every individual subscriber to a community solar project participating in the Adjustable Block 
Program or ILSFA must receive and execute an individualized standard disclosure form.606 The Final 
 
605 As noted in Section 7.9.6.3, both Ameren Illinois and Commonwealth Edison currently have tariffs related to community solar net 
metering open before the Commission; neither utility has proposed to change the portability and transferability provisions of its tariffs.

Order  in  Docket  No.  22-0231  reiterates  this  approval  of  requiring  customer  signature  on 
individualized Disclosure Forms.607 The specific provisions regarding disclosure forms, including 
how they are to be generated and executed, are outlined in the ABP Program Guidebook, ILSFA 
Approved Vendor Manual, and the Consumer Protection Handbook contained in Appendix I to this 
Plan.  
 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(M)(iii) of the IPA Act now expressly provides that the Agency may “require direct 
program participants, including agents operating on their behalf, to provide standardized disclosures 
to a customer prior to that customer's execution of a contract for the development of a distributed 
generation system or a subscription to a community solar project.”  Materials for each program 
specify that the customer must receive, review, and execute that disclosure form before, or no later 
than in conjunction with, that customer’s execution of its contract for the distributed generation 
system or the community solar subscription. If executed in conjunction with a contract, the disclosure 
form must be signed prior to the contract. 
 
Approved Vendors and Designees are not permitted to develop their own version of disclosure forms 
in lieu of the standard Adjustable Block Program or Illinois Solar for All forms, nor may Approved 
Vendors or Designees modify any portion of the form’s standardized content. When the programs 
first launched, Disclosure Forms could be generated only through the Program Administrator’s 
portal.    This  portal-only  process  facilitated  the  Program  Administrators’  reviews  of  project 
applications by ensuring that no Approved Vendors or Designees modified the standard disclosure 
form prior to obtaining a customer signature on the forms.  In response to requests from program 
participants,  the  Program  Administrators  have  developed  application  programming  interfaces 
(“APIs”) that can now be utilized by Approved Vendors and Designees to generate disclosure forms 
outside of the program portals so long as the content remains the standard content.  This process 
may be utilized by Approved Vendors/Designees only after obtaining permission from the Program 
Administrator(s) following a test of the disclosure form generated through the API.  In this way, the 
Program Administrators can ensure that program requirements are being met and that customers 
receive the required standardized (i.e., unmodified) forms. 
 
The Disclosure Forms are currently provided in English, with the ABP Community Solar Disclosure 
Form and the ILSFA DG lease, DG PPA, and Community Solar Disclosure Forms also provided in 
Spanish. After the finalization of the new streamlined Disclosure Forms following a stakeholder 
process, the Agency plans to produce versions of all of the Disclosure Forms in Spanish and any other 
languages that the Informational Brochures are provided in. 
  
The Agency, through its ABP Program Administrator, has seen voluminous examples of companies 
sending Disclosure Forms to email addresses associated with the sales representative, or other 
company email addresses. This behavior is extremely troubling, as the forms are sent to the customer 
for execution using an email address that does not belong to the customer, making it difficult for the 
Program Administrator to verify the identity of the signor.  In some cases, the Agency, through its 
Program Administrator, has seen examples of agents creating false customer email addresses, which 
are then used to generate customer disclosure forms. These situations are brought to the attention 
of the Program Administrator in part through customer complaints, as well as a review of the 
 
607 Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 149-150.

disclosure forms that are submitted with project applications (at Part I of the application process for 
distributed generation, and at Part II of the application process for community solar).  Program 
Administrator investigations into the use of incorrect or false email addresses have shown that on 
some occasions, agents are assisting customers who do not have email addresses, while at other 
times agents are acting outside of program requirements surrounding disclosure forms.  In order to 
prevent Approved Vendors, Designees, subcontractors, and/or other agents from engaging in this 
deceptive practice, and to avoid the possibility of so-called “bad actors” from executing disclosure 
forms on the behalf of customers, the Agency requires that all customer disclosures be sent to an 
email address belonging to the customer for e-signature. If the customer does not have an email 
address, or does not wish to share it, an email address waiver form is available, and the customer will 
need to wet sign a hard copy of the Disclosure Form. 
 
The Agency requires that all Disclosure Forms executed outside of the ABP portal (which is only 
permitted through the API process described above) must utilize a commercially-available third 
party e-signature platform in order to provide an independent audit trail of the customer’s signature.  
Commercially available third-party signature platforms are systems that are available to the public 
under standard terms and conditions or are available at list prices offered to the public. Such 
commercially-available  platforms  are  widely  available  through  well-known  providers  such  as 
DocuSign and Acrobat, though at a charge to the user.  Approved Vendors and Designees that do not 
wish to incur the charges for use of these commercially-available third-party signature verification 
platforms  may  use  the  signature  features  available  within  the  ABP  portal  without  incurring 
additional charges.  While the Agency understands that some entities participating in the programs 
may have their own internal e-signature platforms, the Agency believes that it is imperative to 
require a commercially available e-signature verification tool to ensure that bad actor agents cannot 
disrupt and/or circumvent the Agency’s consumer protection process.  This requirement is not new 
to the program requirements, but recently has gained attention as community solar subscriptions 
became more widely available in Illinois.  The IPA thus sought that the Commission affirm this 
specific requirement through its Plan. 
The Agency has received feedback that the Disclosure Forms for both the ABP and ILSFA should be 
streamlined and shortened. As part of this 2022 Plan, the Agency is submitting updated and revised 
Disclosure Forms for ABP and ILSFA, and for both distributed generation projects and community 
solar subscriptions. The forms are designed to be shorter, to focus on the key information while 
flagging other issues of which the customer should be aware, and to increase consistency in 
Disclosure Form design and content across all offers. Additional details on the new proposed forms 
are discussed below. The Agency is open to further modifications to these Disclosure Forms through 
a stakeholder process, which it plans to commence in the fall of 2022; however, the Agency felt it was 
important to provide new, redesigned documents as a starting place for further adjustments. As with 
other  program  documents  and  materials,  the  Agency  requested  Commission  approval  of  the 
Disclosure Form requirement and the general approach in the attached proposed new Disclosure 
Forms, while allowing adjustments to be made outside of the Long-Term Plan process prior to the 
next Plan filing.  The Commission specifically approved the requirement for customer-specific 
Disclosure Forms and the requirement that the customer sign their Disclosure Form, as well as the 
Agency’s proposal to continue to update Program documents, as appropriate, outside of the Plan 
proceeding.608

Various versions of the new Disclosure Forms are included in Appendix I-2, including forms for ABP 
DG purchases, leases, PPAs; ABP community solar subscriptions; ILSFA purchases, leases, PPAs; and 
ILSFA community solar subscriptions. The Agency will initiate a stakeholder process to consider 
additional modifications to these new Disclosure Forms before finalizing them and requiring their 
use. Because the forms now all look very similar, and there have already been instances of AVs or 
Designees filling out and having customers sign the wrong type of form (e.g., a DG form instead of a 
community solar form), different form types will now have different color schemes: blue for ABP DG 
forms, green for ABP community solar forms, and yellow for ILSFA forms. 
 
The Disclosure Forms incorporate dynamic elements, which allow for information that is only 
relevant for some offers to only appear on the Disclosure Form for those offers where it is relevant, 
and not be shown when not relevant. This allows the forms to include all important information while 
not cluttering up and lengthening the forms with unhelpful text. Appendix I therefore includes 
multiple versions of some of the same Disclosure Forms to show the dynamic elements and how the 
form would appear when different inputs are given.  
 
The Agency received feedback from stakeholders surrounding the requirements for customers to 
execute an additional disclosure form when the terms of their agreement have changed.  Specifically, 
if the size of a customer’s distributed generation system or community solar subscription changes 
beyond the allowable size bands (greater of 5% or 1 kW AC for DG; greater of 2kW or 10% for 
Community Solar subscriptions), or – in the in the case of community solar – if the customer’s 
subscription is moved from one project to another, they must be presented with a new, updated 
disclosure form, which must be executed by the customer prior to changes in the customer’s 
agreement with the Approved Vendor/Designee.  Stakeholders have requested that the Agency lift 
this requirement for changes to community solar subscriptions in order to ensure that customers’ 
subscription sizes can be right-sized to the customers’ needs or changes in usage. 609  Previously, the 
IPA was unwilling to accept these changes without guardrails in order to reduce the possibility for 
gaming by Approved Vendors seeking to maximize payments under REC Contracts by adjusting 
subscription sizes or switching customers to undersubscribed projects at the end of an invoicing 
period.  In order to facilitate right-sizing of community solar subscriptions, the Agency proposed a 
modified  approach:  (1)  for  subscriptions  where  the  customer  pays  a  set  percentage  of  their 
community solar bill credits as their subscription fee (guaranteeing a set percentage level of savings), 
subscriptions may be increased or decreased by up to 5 kW or 25% without requiring a new 
Disclosure  Form;  however,  the  Approved  Vendor  or  Designee  must  notify  the  customer  for 
adjustments more than 2 kW or 10%; (2) for all other offer structures, the existing size restrictions 
(the greater of 2 kW or 10%) will continue to apply.  
 
In the 2022 Plan approval proceeding (Docket No. 22-0231), in response to parties’ arguments, the 
Agency proposed additional flexibility with respect to moving customers between community solar 
projects. Specifically, the Agency proposed to allow Approved Vendors/Designees to switch a 
customer from one community solar project to another without the execution of a new Disclosure 
Form in two situations: (1) when the customer requests the switch, or (2) when the customer 
 
609 While not specifically referenced, the Agency understands that these comments are only applicable to customers subscribed to a project 
within the Traditional Community Solar category, rather than the Community-Driven Community Solar category.

requests a subscription size increase that cannot be accommodated by their current project. The 
Agency’s updated proposal was approved by the Commission in its Final Order.610  
9.5.1.  ABP Disclosure Forms 
The Agency, in conjunction with its Program Administrator, developed standardized disclosure 
forms to be completed and provided to each program participant for signature prior to contract 
execution.  The standard disclosure form must be presented without modification to all customers 
who host a distributed generation project which will participate in the program, as well as all 
customers who enroll as subscribers to community solar projects participating in the program.  In its 
Order approving the Agency’s Revised Plan in Docket 19-0995, the Commission provided analysis 
reinforcing  the  requirement  that  every  individual  subscriber  to  a  community  solar  project 
participating in the Adjustable Block Program must receive and execute an individualized standard 
Disclosure Form.611 The Commission reiterated its approval of this requirement in the Final Order in 
Docket 22-0231.612  This requirement extends across all six distinct categories of the program. 
For distributed generation projects, there are standard Disclosure Forms for project purchases, 
leases, and PPAs.  The Agency is synthesizing the Disclosure Form for projects over 25 kW in size 
with the streamlined form also applicable to projects under 25 kW in size, as it believes these projects 
are better addressed with the Disclosure Forms specific to the DG offer type (purchase, lease, or PPA). 
The DG Disclosure Forms provide important information in a standardized format, including: 
•  contact information 
•  information on pricing, payment amount and timing, and fees 
•  information on REC incentive payments, including amount of the expected payment and how 
much is passed on to the customer 
•  information on the solar project itself, including installation, design, and efficiency 
•  information on net metering 
•  information on maintenance, warranties and guarantees 
•  information on what happens if the customer moves 
•  information on early termination or completion of the contract (for lease and PPA) 
•  estimates of the value of electricity produced by the project and estimated savings 
The proposed new DG Disclosure Forms for both ILSFA and ABP incorporate a dynamic element to 
address offers that rely on the project using the smart inverter rebate.  When the Approved Vendor 
or Designee indicates that the project will use the rebate, the section on net metering will be retitled 
“Net Metering and Smart Inverter Rebate” and will explain the rebate with related disclosures and 
explain how it affects the net metering rate. In the “Value of Electricity and Savings Estimates” section, 
the form will state that the estimated value of electricity from the project includes the smart inverter 
rebate (if the rebate is retained by the customer), and the value of the electricity calculations will be 
adjusted to reflect that electricity estimated to be used directly by the customer will be valued at the 
full retail rate, whereas the excess net metered electricity will be valued at the generation rate. There

611 See Docket No. 19-0995, Final Order dated February 18, 2020 at 7. In the event that the Commission or another authoritative 
adjudicatory body determines that an opt-out municipal aggregation may legally include community solar subscription aggregation for a 
project participating in the Adjustable Block Program or ILSFA, individually executed standard disclosure forms would still be required for 
each individual subscriber.

will also be a new, automatically-generated disclosure section if the Approved Vendor holds a 
collateral payment that is later refunded.613  
The Agency provides standard electricity prices (and other inputs) to be used for the estimates of the 
value of electricity generated and savings so as to allow customers to make equivalent comparisons 
across multiple offers from developers.  Standard disclosure forms must be presented to customers 
for review and signed by customers confirming that review prior to the execution of the underlying 
sales contract to ensure that customers understand the terms and conditions of their installation. 
For community solar subscribers, the Disclosure Form includes:  
•  contact information 
•  information on the community solar project (if known at the time of form generation and 
execution) 
•  information on the subscription, including size, term, and estimated production 
•  subscription rate and payment information, including fees 
•  information on early termination 
•  estimates of total community solar bill credits, along with savings estimates or information 
on how to understand overall savings (this varies by rate structure) 
An additional disclosure is automatically generated if the Approved Vendor or Designee indicates 
that the community solar offer requires the subscriber to sign up with an Alternative Retail Electric 
Supplier for their energy supply. As with the DG Disclosure Form, to acknowledge and demonstrate 
receipt and review, customers must execute the community solar disclosure form prior to execution 
of the underlying subscription contact; e-signatures are acceptable (and widely utilized given that 
community solar subscriber onboard often occurs through online transactions), but to ensure the 
integrity of customer execution, only using commercially available third-party e-signature systems.   
In 2020, the Agency updated the Community Solar Disclosure Form in response to feedback received 
in stakeholder comments, and the revised Community Solar Disclosure Form was shortened and 
streamlined.   At  that  time,  the  Community  Solar  Informational  Brochure  was  attached  to  the 
disclosure  form.  This  approach  will  now  be  taken  for  all  Disclosure  Forms—the  applicable 
Informational Brochure will automatically be attached as the first two pages. For ABP DG purchases, 
the Going Solar flyer (formerly the Illinois Shines Timeline) will also be attached.  
The Agency previously sought stakeholder feedback on whether there should be a threshold for 
system efficiencies in the program to ensure inefficient or suboptimal systems were not sold, leased, 
or financed through a PPA to customers unknowingly. Feedback received noted this proposal was 
not supported, as it would create barriers to development for customers who desire to install a sub-
optimal system.  Rather, stakeholder feedback indicated a need for increased customer education 
surrounding system production, and suggested that it be addressed on the disclosure form. As 
explained above, the Agency submitted revised Disclosure Forms as part of this 2022 Plan filing, 
which will be finalized after a stakeholder process. The Disclosure Forms for distributed generation 
projects incorporate a proposed new section that discloses the efficiency of the project using the 
format shown in Figure 9-1: 
 
613 The discussion regarding a new section in Disclosure Forms to address the smart inverter “DG” rebate is expanded in the Final Plan as 
compared to the initial filed Plan pursuant to the Final Order in Docket No. 22-0231, at 150.

Figure 9-1: Disclosure Form Project Efficiency Graphic 
 
This disclosure briefly discusses reasons that a system might be less efficient and provides the 
specific efficiency of the customer’s project on a bar from 0% to 25%. For projects with “good” (15%-
20%) or “high” efficiency (20%-25%), the bar would be colored green. For “somewhat” efficient 
projects (10%-15%), the bar would be yellow. For lower efficiency projects (0%-10%), the bar would 
be colored red. The Agency believes that this graphic will help customers quickly and easily 
understand what efficiency levels are typical for solar projects (e.g., an efficiency between 20% and 
25% might seem very low to someone unfamiliar with solar projects, while in fact, that would be a 
quite high efficiency for a solar project) and what the efficiency of their specific project would be 
(both as an efficiency percentage for their project, as well as in comparison to other projects). The 
Agency remains open to alternative ways to present this information, including a disclosure graphic 
that would show the customer their project’s capacity factor in comparison to other ABP and ILSFA 
distributed generation projects. 
The Agency maintains that it is vital for customers to be provided with resources that explain both 
the State-administered incentive program in which the customer is participating as well as the 
agreement the customer is entering into with their Approved Vendor or Designee (whether that be a 
community solar subscription or the installation of a behind-the-meter distributed generation 
system). As such, the Agency intends to continue to provide educational materials through the 
program’s informational brochure (which will now be attached to the Disclosure Forms) as well as 
the Illinois Shines website and will continue to develop additional robust educational materials that 
will address information stripped from the current disclosure forms.   
9.5.2.  ILSFA Disclosure Forms 
As with the ABP, the Agency proposed a new set of redesigned ILSFA Disclosure Forms to address 
general feedback that the forms need to be simplified and streamlined, as well as to address more 
detailed comments on specific disclosures. The forms are designed to maximize consistency between 
ABP and ILSFA, while still tailoring the ILSFA Disclosure Forms to reflect program-specific elements. 
There are three new ILSFA distributed generation Disclosure Forms for the three financing types 
(purchase, lease, and PPA). Instead of having a separate form for Non-Profits and Public Facilities, 
dynamic options are incorporated into the three DG forms to allow for disclosures specific to Non-
Profits and Public Facilities. There is also a redesigned ILSFA community solar Disclosure Form.  The 
Agency expects that additional ILSFA forms, or modified versions of these forms, will need to be 
developed through the Fall 2022 stakeholder process, or subsequent stakeholder processes, to 
accommodate  new  ownership  models  that  may  emerge  with  the  encouragement  of  energy 
sovereignty.

The applicable ILSFA standard disclosure form must be presented without modification to all 
customers who host a distributed generation project that will participate in the program, as well as 
all customers who enroll as subscribers to community solar projects participating in the program.  
Standard disclosure forms must be presented to customers for review and signed by customers 
confirming that review prior to the execution of the underlying sales contract to ensure that 
customers understand the terms and conditions of their purchase.  In its Order approving the 
Agency’s  Revised  Plan  in  Docket  19-0995,  the  Commission  provided  analysis  reinforcing  the 
requirement that every individual subscriber to a community solar project participating in the 
Agency’s programs must receive and execute an individualized standard Disclosure Form.614  The 
Commission reiterated its approval of this requirement in the Final Order in Docket 22-0231.615   This 
requirement extends across all four ILSFA categories. 
The ILSFA distributed generation Disclosure Forms include: 
•  contact information 
•  information on pricing, payment amount and timing, and fees 
•  information on REC incentive payments 
•  information on the solar project itself, including installation, design, and efficiency 
•  information on net metering 
•  information on maintenance, warranties and guarantees 
•  information on what happens if the customer moves 
•  forbearance requirements in the case of default 
•  information on early termination or completion of the contract (for lease and PPA) 
•  estimates of the value of electricity produced by the project and estimated savings, including 
a calculation of savings as a percentage of the value of energy generated by the solar project 
The agency received a comment on the need for ILSFA distributed generation Disclosure Forms to 
address the possibility of projects that use the smart inverter rebate (also known as the DG rebate). 
Both the ILSFA and ABP proposed new DG Disclosure Forms incorporate a dynamic element to 
address offers that rely on the project using the smart inverter rebate. When the Approved Vendor 
or Designee indicates that the project will use the rebate, the section on net metering will be retitled 
“Net Metering and Smart Inverter Rebate” and will explain the rebate with related disclosures and 
explain how it affects the net metering rate. In the “Value of Electricity and Savings Estimates” section, 
the form will state that the estimated value of electricity from the project includes the smart inverter 
rebate (if the rebate is retained by the customer), and the value of the electricity calculations will be 
adjusted to reflect that electricity estimated to be used directly by the customer will be valued at the 
full retail rate, whereas the excess net metered electricity will be valued at the generation rate.  
As discussed in Section 8.11, the Agency proposed to eliminate the seven-day waiting period between 
when an ILSFA customer signs the Disclosure Form and when they can sign their contract, and 
proposed to increase the rescission period from seven days to fourteen. The Commission approved

project participating in the Adjustable Block Program or ILSFA, individually executed standard disclosure forms would still be required for 
each individual subscriber.

this approach616 and these changes are reflected in the new ILSFA distributed generation Disclosure 
Forms.  
The ILSFA community solar subscription Disclosure Form includes: 
•  contact information 
•  information on the community solar project  
•  information on the subscription, including size, term, and estimated production 
•  subscription rate and payment information, including fees 
•  information on early termination, transferring the subscription, and subscription renewal 
•  estimates of total community solar bill credits, along with savings estimates, including 
savings as a percentage of the value of energy generated by the subscription 
An additional disclosure is automatically generated if the Approved Vendor or Designee indicates 
that the community solar offer requires the subscriber to sign up with an Alternative Retail Electric 
Supplier for their energy supply. 
To acknowledge and demonstrate receipt and review, customers must execute the community solar 
Disclosure  Form  prior  to  execution  of  the  underlying  subscription  contact;  e-signatures  are 
acceptable (and widely utilized given that community solar subscriber onboard often occurs through 
online transactions), but to ensure the integrity of customer execution, only using commercially 
available third-party e-signature systems.   
The Agency maintains that it is vital for customers to be provided with resources that explain both 
the State-administered incentive program in which the customer is participating as well as the 
agreement the customer is entering into with their Approved Vendor or Designee (whether that be a 
community solar subscription or the installation of a behind-the-meter distributed generation 
system). As such, the Agency intends to continue to provide educational materials through the 
program’s informational brochures (which will now be attached to the Disclosure Forms) as well as 
on the Illinois Solar for All website and will continue to develop additional robust educational 
materials specifically designed to meet the needs of the communities served by the Illinois Solar for 
All Program.   
9.6.  Consumer Complaint Center and Complaint Database 
Section 1-75(c)(1)(M)(iv) of the IPA Act requires the Agency to establish one or multiple Consumer 
Complaint Centers to accept complaints regarding businesses that participate in, or otherwise benefit 
from, State-administered incentive funding through Agency-administered programs.  Section 1-
75(c)(1)(M)(iv) further requires that the Agency maintain a public database of complaints with any 
confidential or particularly sensitive information redacted from public entries. 
In March 2020, the ABP Program Administrator launched an online consumer complaint database617 
which lists all consumer complaints received by the Program Administrator in an abridged format, 
identifying the entity about whom the complaint was filed, the entity’s role in the program (i.e., 
Designee, Approved Vendor), and the date, subject, type, and status of the complaint.  The database 
 
616 See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 127. 
617 This database is hosted on both the Adjustable Block Program website (designed for use by program participants) as well as on the 
customer-facing Illinois Shines-branded website.  See https://illinoisabp.com/consumer-complaint-database/;    
https://illinoisshines.com/consumer-complaint-database/.

also identifies Approved Vendors and Designees that have been suspended from the program; 
additional information related to suspensions for program participants is outlined in a disciplinary 
actions report which is also available on the consumer complaint database webpage. 
The Program Administrators for both programs will continue to provide consumer protection 
materials on a program website and through printed materials.  The Adjustable Block Program 
Administrator has developed its customer-facing IllinoisShines.com website and program branding 
in part to accomplish this end.  The Illinois Solar for All Program website highlights information for 
Illinois Residents on its homepage, making all such information clearly available to customers.  The 
Program  Administrators  will  continue  to  work  to  develop  these  websites  with  materials  for 
customers as future needs are identified.   
The ABP Program Administrator also provides a toll-free consumer protection telephone hotline and 
web-based complaint forms, and the Program Administrator receives, responds to, and documents 
complaints about marketing practices, sales practices, installations, and other aspects of installing 
solar or subscribing to community solar.  The Illinois Solar for All Program also maintains a toll-free 
customer telephone line for questions and complaints from program participants (i.e., customers and 
subscribers).    If  Approved  Vendors  and/or  Designees  are  not  responsive  to  the  Program 
Administrator  during  a  compliant  investigation  or  respond  unsatisfactorily  to  the  Program 
Administrator during the investigation of a complaint, that Program entity's ABP portal access will 
be shut off and the entity will be prohibited from generating Disclosure Forms or submitting Part I 
applications. Restricted ABP portal access may be lifted once the entity begins responding in a 
satisfactory manner or once the investigation concludes, whichever comes first. 
The Illinois Solar for All Program, perhaps as a result of its limited size in comparison to the 
Adjustable Block Program, receives significantly fewer customer complaints.  As of the date of this 
2022 Long-Term Plan, no ILSFA Approved Vendors or Designees have been disciplined for action 
arising from consumer complaints specific to the ILSFA Program,618 and accordingly, there is no 
customer complaint database that exists on the ILSFA website, though the Agency plans to develop a 
database in compliance with the requirements of P.A. 102-0662.  
9.7.  Annual Complaint Report  
Section 1-75(c)(1)(M)(v) of the IPA Act requires the Agency to provide an annual written report to 
the Commission documenting the frequency and nature of complaints arising from its programs, as 
well as any enforcement actions taken in response to those complaints.   This new statutory 
requirement mirrors an existing administrative requirement, as it was a provision of the Initial and 
Revised Long-Term Plans.  The first such report, covering calendar year 2019, was provided to the 
Commission through a filing in Docket No. 17-0838 on March 2, 2020.  The second report, covering 
calendar year 2020, was filed in Docket No. 19-0995 on February 9, 2021. 
The Agency will continue to provide an annual written report to the Commission documenting the 
frequency and nature of complaints and any enforcement actions taken. As the programs have grown 
and changed since their inception, this annual report has consequently changed as well.  Low 
numbers of complaints associated with the Illinois Solar for All Program have resulted in past reports 
 
618 The ILSFA Program Administrator has only sent one suspension letter to date, and it was to an entity that was not registered as an 
ILSFA Approved Vendor or Designee. On August 3, 2022, the ILSFA Program Administrator suspended an entity that had misrepresented 
the availability of ILSFA incentives to a customer and completed the project in a manner that made it ineligible for ILSFA.

titled as an “Adjustable Block Program” report, despite the fact that the report includes information 
on Illinois Solar for All complaints.  For example, in 2020, only five complaints were filed with the 
Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator.  These complaints were relatively minor in comparison 
to the Adjustable Block Program complaints, but nonetheless were briefly explained in the Agency’s 
report filed in 19-0995.  The Agency has not found that it is necessary to develop a separate annual 
report at this time but will assess this need as the program matures.  Additionally, the Agency will 
ensure that future reports will fully detail complaints received under both programs. 
 
The third annual report, covering calendar year 2021, was filed with the Commission in Docket No. 
19-0995 on February 25, 2022. The 2021 report cataloged the complaints received by the Adjustable 
Block Program across 2021 and the disciplinary actions taken by the Program Administrators. The 
report also describes various challenges the program faced in 2021 and the impact of those 
challenges on customer experiences, including but not limited to, the lack of funding to open 
additional blocks of capacity prior to the enactment of Public Act 102-0662 and strains on the 
program caused by the COVID-19 global health pandemic.  Future reports will be published on the 
program website and filed in the Commission docket approving the Agency’s most-recently approved 
Long-Term Plan. 
This  report  is  a  vital  way  that  the  Agency  ensures  transparency  with  the  public  concerning 
complaints received regarding program participants. Continuous monitoring of complaints and 
maintenance of the program’s Consumer Protection Database, which documents all complaints 
received and suspensions from the program, ensures that resolution and corrective action can be 
taken with each specific complaint, and/or the program at large prior to the filing of this public report 
each calendar year.619  
9.8.  Consumer Protection Working Group 
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 1-75(c)(1)(M)(vi) of the IPA Act, the Agency shall schedule 
regular meetings with representatives of the Office of the Attorney General, the Illinois Commerce 
Commission, consumer protection groups, and other interested stakeholders to share relevant 
information about consumer protection, project compliance, and complaints received.  The IPA has 
already developed an ad hoc “Consumer Protection Working Group” and will continue to convene 
meetings on a monthly basis. To date, participation in the Working Group has been mostly limited to 
the Agency, Program Administrators, Commission staff, Office of the Attorney General, and Citizens 
Utility Board, and the meetings have primarily focused on observed consumer protection issues and 
violations of program requirements, and disciplinary responses to violations. The Agency received 
comments about the openness of these meetings to other interested parties, including the solar 
industry. On August 18, 2022, the Agency announced the expansion of the Consumer Protection 
Working Group.620 The Agency will recalibrate the meetings as a forum for discussing market trends, 
best practices, consumer education, and other consumer protection issues generally with a broader 
group of stakeholders. The Agency also intends to continue to meet separately with Commission staff 
and the Office of the Attorney General, and other regulatory or legal enforcement agencies and

consumer  protection  organizations as  appropriate,  to  discuss specific  program  violations and 
disciplinary actions. 
Additionally, 1-75(c)(1)(M)(vii) of the IPA Act requires that, to the extent that complaints received 
implicate the jurisdiction of the Office of the Attorney General, the Illinois Commerce Commission, or 
local, State, or federal law enforcement, the Agency shall refer complaints to those entities as 
appropriate.  The IPA will continue to bring such complaints to the attention of the Attorney General 
and the Commission as appropriate and will likewise involve other law enforcement agencies as 
necessary.  If warranted, the Program Administrator will refer complaints to the Agency and to 
appropriate state and federal agencies, including the Consumer Fraud Bureau of the Illinois Attorney 
General’s Office, or the Illinois Commerce Commission (e.g., for failure of installers to maintain their 
status as Certified Distributed Generation Installers).  Approved Vendors or Designees found by the 
Agency to have violated consumer protection standards or related Program requirements may be 
subject to suspension or revocation of their Approved Vendor status or Designee registration by the 
Agency, and if in violation of local, state, or federal law, also potential civil or criminal penalties from 
other relevant authorities.

10.  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
Public Act 102-0662 amended the Illinois Power Agency Act to expand the “priority access to the 
clean energy economy for businesses and workers from communities that have been excluded from 
economic opportunities in  the  energy sector, have been  subject  to  disproportionate  levels  of 
pollution, and have disproportionately experienced negative public health outcomes.”621 To advance 
that objective, the Act directs the Agency to establish an equity accountability system, which shall 
include:  
1.  Minimum equity standards applicable to all applicants to the Agency’s renewably energy 
procurements, both through the Adjustable Block Program and competitive procurements.  
2.  The Equity Eligible Contractor category within the Adjustable Block Program (see Chapter 7).  
3.  Requirements for competitive procurement processes that advance the equity goals of the 
Act (see Chapter 5).  
The Act further establishes several required monitoring, reporting, and facilitation requirements to 
support the assessment of the equity accountability system. Section 1-75(c-10)(4) of the IPA Act 
directs the Agency to include the following in each revision to the Long-Term Renewable Resources 
Procurement Plan:  
4.  Current number of Equity Eligible Contractors certified by the Agency. 
5.  A mechanism for measuring and reporting project workforce profiles at the Approved Vendor 
or Designee level.  
6.  Training, guidance, and other support for Approved Vendors, Designees, Equity Eligible 
Contractors, and other stakeholders for meeting the requirements of the EEC category within 
Adjustable Block Program and the minimum equity standards laid out in this section.  
7.  A process for certifying Equity Eligible Contractors and persons (please see Chapter 7 for 
more details).  
8.  A waiver application process for rare cases of inability to meet the minimum equity standard.  
This chapter and additional information in Chapter 7 fulfill those requirements. 
The Act also empowers the Agency to assess and attempt to ameliorate existing racial discrimination 
or disparities in rates of participation in the clean energy economy. Section 1-75(c-15)(2) directs the 
Agency to commission and publish a racial disparity study to “measure[] the presence and impact of 
discrimination on minority businesses and workers in Illinois’ clean energy economy.”  Section 1-
75(c-20) directs the Agency to “collect data from program applicants in order to track and improve 
equitable distribution of benefits across Illinois communities for all procurements the Agency 
conducts.” And finally, Section 1-75(c-25) directs the Agency to work with the Department of 
Commerce and Economic Opportunity to create an Energy Workforce Equity Database in order to 
facilitate the engagement of Equity Eligible Contractors and persons on clean energy projects.  
The opportunity to register as an Equity Eligible Contractor (“EEC”) through the Adjustable Block 
Program began on December 14, 2021 and as of the  August 23, 2022, filing this 2022 Long-Term

Plan, updated to reflect the Commission’s Final Order approving the Plan,622 three entities have 
registered.  
10.1.  Equity Accountability System 
To  achieve  “priority  access  to  the  clean  energy  economy  for  businesses  and  workers  from 
communities that have been excluded from economic opportunities in the energy sector, have been 
subject to disproportionate levels of pollution, and have disproportionately experienced negative 
public health outcomes,” the Agency will create the Equity Accountability System, which includes the 
minimum equity standards for all renewable energy procurements, the equity category of the 
Adjustable Block Program, and the equity prioritization for competitive procurements.  
 
All programs and procurements will be designed to encourage participating projects to use a diverse 
and equitable workforce and a diverse set of contractors, including minority-owned businesses, 
disadvantaged businesses, trade unions, graduates of workforce training programs created through 
Public Act 102-0662, and small businesses.  
10.1.1.  Minimum Equity Standards 
Section 1-75(c-10)(1) of the IPA Act as established by Public Act 102-0662 requires that, 
All applications for renewable energy credit procurements shall comply with specific 
minimum equity commitments. Starting in the delivery year immediately following the 
next long-term renewable resources procurement plan, at least 10% of the project 
workforce for each entity participating in a procurement program outlined in this 
subsection (c-10) must be done by equity eligible persons or equity eligible contractors. 
The Agency shall increase the minimum percentage each delivery year thereafter by 
increments that ensure a statewide average of 30% of the project workforce for each 
entity participating in a procurement program is done by equity eligible persons or 
equity eligible contractors by 2030. The Agency shall propose a schedule of percentage 
increases to the minimum equity standards in its draft revised renewable energy 
resources procurement plan submitted to the Commission for approval pursuant to 
paragraph (5) of subsection (b) of Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. In 
determining these annual increases, the Agency shall have the discretion to establish 
different minimum equity standards for different types of procurements and different 
regions of the State if the Agency finds that doing so will further the purposes of this 
subsection (c-10). The proposed schedule of annual increases shall be revisited and 
updated on an annual basis. Revisions shall be developed with stakeholder input, 
including from equity eligible persons, equity eligible contractors, clean energy industry 
representatives, and community-based organizations that work with such persons and 
contractors.623 
Section 1-10 of the IPA Act as amended by P.A. 102-0662 defines “equity eligible persons” or “eligible 
persons” as: 1) graduates or current or former participants in the Clean Jobs Workforce Network 
Program,  Clean  Energy  Contractor  Incubator  Program,  Illinois  Climate  Works  Preapprentice 
Program, Returning Residents Clean Jobs Training Program, or the Clean Energy Primes Contractor

Accelerator Program, and the solar training pipeline and multicultural jobs program; 2) persons who 
are graduates of or currently enrolled in the foster care system; 3) persons who were formerly 
incarcerated; and 4) persons whose primary residence is in an equity eligible investment community. 
Section 1-10 of the IPA Act does not provide a definition for “project workforce,” which is the group 
upon which the Minimum Equity Standard applies. Therefore, the IPA has developed a definition that 
reflects the context and language in Sections 1-75(c-10), (c-15), (c-20), and (c-25) as well as 
previously IPA-published guidance regarding required workforce reporting. For the purposes of the 
Minimum Equity Standards, the IPA will define “project workforce” as the following: 
“Employees,  contractors  and  their  employees,  and  subcontractors  and  their 
employees, whose job duties are directly required by or substantially related to the 
development, construction, and operation of a project that is participating in or 
intended to participate in the IPA-administered programs and procurements under 
Section 1-75(c) of the IPA Act. This shall include both project installation workforce 
and workforce in administrative, sales, marketing, and technical roles where those 
workers’ duties are performed in Illinois.”624 
The Equity Accountability System will take effect in the first delivery year after the approval of this 
Plan, which is the 2023-2024 delivery year beginning June 1, 2023. For the 2023-2024 delivery year, 
the minimum equity standard therefore will be 10%. The Agency proposes to increase the minimum 
equity standard to 12% for the 2024-2025 delivery year. In the next Long-Term Plan, the Agency will 
propose future increases of the minimum equity standard over subsequent delivery years to 
eventually reach the 30% statutory requirement by 2030. A slower initial rate of increase will 
provide the solar industry time to prepare for these standards, as well as allow for workforce 
development and other programs administered by the Department of Commerce and Economic 
Opportunity to have time to ramp up. At this time, the Agency does not propose requiring different 
minimum equity standards for different regions of the state as the Agency does not have information 
on how those standards should differ by region, including the local availability of Equity Eligible 
Persons and contractors. The Agency will instead evaluate the initial performance of the Equity 
Accountability System in its first year to consider regional adjustments in the next Plan update that 
will take place in 2023 for implementation in 2024.  
For more information on the definition of Equity Eligible Persons and Equity Eligible Contractors, see 
Section 7. 
Compliance with the minimum equity standard entails submission of a Minimum Equity Standard 
Compliance Plan, an end-of-delivery-year Minimum Equity Standard Report, and a mid-delivery-year 
confirmation that the entity is on track to achieve the minimum equity standard. Submission of these 
documents is mandatory and a condition for participation in relevant programs and procurements, 
as discussed below.  
10.1.1.1.  Applicability to Noncompetitive Procurements  
Section 1-75(c-10)(1) provides that “[a]ll applications for renewable energy credit procurements 
shall comply with specific minimum equity commitments.” That section does not define “renewable

329,337,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
energy credit procurements” but does specify that the 10% minimum equity standard applies to 
“each entity participating in a procurement program outlined in this subsection (c-10).” Other 
requirements  under  this  subsection  are  only  required  from  “each  entity  participating  in  a 
procurement program of subsection (c) of this Section,” and Section 1-75(c-30) provides that the 
penalty for non-compliance with (c-10) shall be to “deny the entity's ability to participate in 
procurement programs in subsection (c).” The Agency therefore interprets this section as only 
applying to those renewable energy procurement programs established through Section 1-75(c) of 
the Act, not to include the Illinois Solar for All Program.  This interpretation is further supported by 
the distinct treatment of the Illinois Solar for All Program throughout the IPA Act, including higher 
REC prices, the absence of prevailing wage requirements, and dedicated funding through the 
Renewable Energy Resources Fund, all of which operate to ease the burden of program participation 
and maximize the access for and benefit to low-income participants. The Agency believes that the 
above reading of Section 1-75(c-10) also strengthens those aims.  
Other elements of the broader suite of diversity and equity provisions added to Section 1-75 of the 
IPA Act through Public Act 102-0662 will apply to Illinois Solar for All, such as the data collection 
obligations contained in Section 1-75(c-20) and inclusion in the studies conducted per Section 1-
75(c-15).  
10.1.1.2.  Applicability to Competitive Procurements   
Under Section 1-75(c-10)(3) of the IPA Act, bidders in the Agency’s competitive procurements for 
RECs from new utility-scale wind, solar, and brownfield site photovoltaic projects are required to 
participate in the Equity Accountability System by making minimum commitments for the utilization 
of Equity Eligible Persons or Equity Eligible Contractors at the applicable level for the delivery year 
in which the procurement event is conducted. The commitments may be submitted in the form of 
letters of intent or executed sub-contracts. If the bidder is an equity eligible person or an equity 
eligible contractor, that will be considered full compliance with this requirement. Full Compliance 
Plans will only be required from successful bidders as discussed below. 
As discussed in Chapter 5, the Agency will prioritize bids that feature commitments to have a higher 
portion of contract value flowing to Equity Eligible Contractors. This will be through an adjustment 
to bid price prior to ranking of bids by price order. 
10.1.1.3.  Compliance Plan Filing  
The Equity Accountability System will take effect at the beginning of the 2023-2024 delivery year on 
June 1, 2023. By the effective date, existing Adjustable Block Program Approved Vendors and 
Designees will be required to file an annual Minimum Equity Standard Compliance Plan (“Compliance 
Plan”), and then after the end of the delivery year a year-end Report to demonstrate how they met 
the annual minimum equity standard, as required by subparagraphs (1)(A) and (1)(C) of Section 1-
75(c-10). The Compliance Plans will reflect how the Approved Vendor or Designee plans to achieve 
compliance with the minimum equity standard percentage for work completed in the upcoming 
delivery year, while the Report will demonstrate how the Approved Vendor or Designee achieved 
compliance with the minimum equity standard for that delivery year.  
If an entity applies to be an Approved Vendor or Designee during a delivery year, the Agency will 
require a Compliance Plan at the time of the initial application. For this Long-Term Plan the Agency 
329 
 ","10.  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ",[],732,21,illinois,False,2022 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan,docs/raw/dump/illinois/IL_State_2022.pdf
330,338,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
will not apply different requirements for different categories of the Adjustable Block Program.  
However, the Agency notes that the Equity Eligible Contractor category of the Adjustable Block 
program is only available to Approved Vendors who are Equity Eligible Contractors and thus 
participation  in  that  program  is  the  functional  equivalent  to  full  compliance  with  the  Equity 
Accountability System. Approved Vendors that are affiliated with each other may be allowed to 
submit a combined Compliance Plan where they have a common parent company. The IPA will issue 
guidance on how to request such permission from the Agency.  
Successful  bidders  in  competitive  procurements  (“Competitive  Procurement  Suppliers”)  are 
required to file a Compliance Plan within 30 days of ICC approval of their bids. Those Compliance 
Plans must be consistent with commitments made during the bid registration process. A Competitive 
Procurement Supplier who has previously filed a Compliance Plan due to having had prior winning 
bids will be required to update their Compliance Plan. 
10.1.1.4.  Compliance Plan Requirements 
Compliance Plans must include the following items: 
i.  A statement of intent to comply with equity accountability standards for the applicable 
delivery year and to hire a diverse project workforce including Equity Eligible Persons 
and Equity Eligible Contractors. This will include a narrative description of how the 
applicant will meet these commitments. 
ii.  Projected number of workers and the demographic breakdown by race, gender, and 
participation in job training or workforce development programs, or other means of 
compliance with the standard for equity eligible persons. 
iii.  Plans for the use of Equity Eligible Contractors, if applicable.  
iv.  Applicant classification (i.e., Minority-owned, Woman-owned, Disabled-owned, Veteran-
owned, Small Business, etc.), if applicable. 
v.  Communication plan for local outreach to increase the utilization of Equity Eligible 
Persons and Equity Eligible Contractors. 
vi.  Status of any corrective actions or adjustments from prior year Compliance Plans. 
vii.  Approved Vendors in the Adjustable Block Program do not need to report on data 
regarding their Designees but shall report which Designees they worked with in the 
delivery year to allow the Agency to correlate activities and compliance. This is not meant 
to relieve Approved Vendors of responsibility to comply with the Equity Accountability 
Standard, but rather to ensure that efforts are not double counted. 
10.1.1.5.  Compliance Plan Assessment  
The Agency will utilize the following graduated rating system to evaluate Compliance Plans: 
1) Needs Development 
2) Accepted 
3) Exceeds Requirements 
Needs Development (a rating of 1): Indicates that the entity will need to review, correct and/or 
include missing compliance items in order for the Compliance Plan to be approved. This rating 
indicates the Agency has identified inconsistencies in the plan that puts the applicant at risk of non-

compliance  and  the  Compliance  Plan  will  not  be  accepted  without  updating  or  inclusion  of 
requirements that need resolution or are missing.  
Accepted (a rating of 2): Indicates that all compliance requirements are in place for Compliance 
Plan approval, and the plan is accepted. This rating indicates the Agency has identified all necessary 
components are present and the plan is operational. 
Exceeds Requirements (a rating of 3): The Compliance Plan is approved. This rating indicates that 
the entity has committed in their written plan to take internal, periodic checks before the mid-year 
confirmation of progress to evaluate continued effectiveness or risk of the plan and will go beyond 
the minimum equity standards by 50% (e.g., if the standard for a delivery year is 10%, they commit 
to achieving 15%). This will include noting best practices and/or areas of adjustment. 
Once the Compliance Plan Assessment review is complete, the Agency will notify the program 
participant of its status to proceed or recommend areas of review for correction. A rating of at least 
2 is required in order to participate. 
10.1.1.6.  Compliance Plan Corrections 
Section 1-75(c-10)(1)(B) and (D) authorize the IPA to “offer corrective action plans to entities that 
are not on track to achieve compliance”625  and “to assist them in obtaining compliance and shall 
allow  continued  access  to  procurement  programs  upon  an  approved  vendor  or  designee 
demonstrating compliance.”626  After the final submission of the Approved Vendor, Designee or 
Competitive Procurement Supplier’s Minimum Equity Standard Compliance Plan, the Agency will 
review and accept or reject the Compliance Plan. Compliance Plans that receive a rating of 1 will be 
rejected  with  a  recommended  corrective  action  plan.  If  the  Agency  discovers  an  area  of  the 
Compliance Plan that needs to be amended or requires correction, the Agency will notify the 
applicant in writing of the required correction(s) within fourteen days. The applicant will have thirty 
days to submit the amended portion of the Compliance Plan. Applicants may request extensions to 
that window that will be granted by the Agency on a case-by-case basis. 
After resubmittal of a corrected Compliance Plan, the Agency will notify the applicant in writing of 
the final re-evaluation status. The Agency will have a period not to exceed twenty-one days to notify 
the program participant of final acceptance of the Compliance Plan.  The Agency will accept multiple 
revisions of a proposed Compliance Plan. The Agency will strive to meet the timelines listed above 
but may need to extend them during times of high Compliance Plan application volumes. 
10.1.1.7.    Final Compliance Plan Approval  
Once the Agency receives the final corrected Compliance Plan from the applicant entity and the 
Agency approves the Compliance Plan, the entity will advance to the next stage of project application 
or procurement. Approved Vendors, Designees, and Competitive Procurement Suppliers must meet 
all minimum equity standards before being awarded a contract for RECs under an IPA program or 
procurement, unless the entity has obtained a waiver. Aggregated results will be posted to the IPA 
website, based on industry classification.

Due to statutory requirements, applicants must submit a Compliance Plan at the beginning of each 
delivery year and an Annual Report after the end of the delivery year for each year that they 
participate in an IPA procurement; however, the Agency will reassess process efficiencies as the 
program progresses. 
10.1.2.  Proposed Implementation Timeline 
The IPA will follow the timeline below for implementation of the Minimum Equity Standard 
Compliance Plan. Implementation will be divided into three phases: 
1.  Compliance Plan Initial Education (3rd and 4th quarters 2022) 
•  Educational webinar to include review of Compliance Plan standards, submittals, 
corrective actions, and final approval 
2.  Compliance Plan Training (1st quarter 2023) 
•  Distribution of application materials and training for applicants 
3.  Compliance Plan Initial Applications (2nd quarter 2023) 
•  Applicants can begin submitting Compliance Plans prior to the June 1, 2023 
launch of the Equity Accountability System requirements 
10.1.3.  Submittal and Reporting Process 
The Agency will require each Approved Vendor, Designee, or Competitive Procurement Supplier to 
confirm  the  Minimum  Equity  Standard  Compliance  Plan  is  progressing  according  to  Agency 
requirements halfway through the delivery year.  That confirmation will take the form of a written 
inquiry from the Agency or Program Administrator.  
Each Approved Vendor, Designee, or Competitive Procurement Supplier must then submit a year-
end report within 45 days after the end of the delivery year in which they have had active 
participation through activities developing a project or projects. If they have no activity during the 
year, that may be indicated on the year-end report and compliance obligations will not apply. This 
will correspond with the due date of the existing Annual Reports for the Adjustable Block Program. 
Year-end reporting will consist of an updated version of the original Compliance Plan submitted at 
the commencement of the delivery year and will include data on actual performance compared to the 
information submitted in the original Compliance Plan. Reporting should also reflect any major 
differences from the Minimum Equity Standard Compliance Plan such as new and innovative ways to 
provide  employment  opportunities  to  low-income  participants  and  residents  within  the 
environmental justice communities. The first Reports will be due after the end of the 2023-2024 
delivery year. 
10.1.3.1.  Waivers for the Minimum Equity Standard 
In the event an Approved Vendor, Designee, or Competitive Procurement Supplier is unable to fulfill 
the minimum equity standards for a given delivery year, Section 1-75(c-10)(1)(D) allows that entity 
to seek a waiver. The Agency retains the sole discretion to grant a waiver in rare circumstances. The 
Agency will grant waivers where the applicant provides evidence of significant due diligence toward 
meeting the minimum equity standards. These efforts should include:  
332

i.  A brief narrative describing the entity’s effort to recruit Equity Eligible Persons prior to 
the start of project development. Such an effort should include utilization of the Energy 
Equity Workforce Database developed by the Agency as well as the following: 
a.  Working consistently and assertively with approved State job training and workforce 
development programs to recruit a diverse workforce  and provide evidence of 
outreach 
b.  Maintaining  applications  of  individuals  not selected  for  an opening  for contact 
regarding future project openings 
c.  Participating in State approved workforce training facilities for job fairs and related 
local community events to recruit a diverse workforce 
ii.  Efforts to hire or contract with Equity Eligible Contractors should be demonstrated 
through documentation from affiliated community-based organizations and/or training 
program facilities, State workforce hubs, union hall registers, professional development 
associations, etc. This should include the date of contact, the agency official and title of the 
individual contacted. 
iii.  An attestation providing details of open positions or request for bids where the entity has 
not received inquiries or proposals from Equity Eligible Contractors or Equity Eligible 
Persons.   
iv.  Utilization of the Energy Workforce Equity Database. 
v.  Efforts to proactively establish contracting relationships with Equity Eligible Contractors. 
vi.  Advertising or formal solicitation using various platforms of targeted social media for no 
less than thirty (30) business days. Engagement in direct and extensive outreach to 
appropriately-targeted associations or other relevant organizations to notify them of the 
project opportunity.627  
vii.  Evidence that the entity posted all project solicitations on appropriate State agency 
websites, include direct targeted e-mail alerts to appropriate respondents who have 
registered with State agencies to learn of opportunities.  
Waivers approved for lack of Equity Eligible Persons or Equity Eligible Contractors in a geographic 
area of a project shall not count against the program participant in assessment of compliance with 
the minimum equity standard. 
Waiver extensions or subsequent waiver requests from an applicant will need to specify efforts made 
to reach compliance. Section 1-75(c-10)(4)(E) of the IPA Act directs that, “[w]hen considering 
whether to grant a waiver, and to what extent, the Agency shall consider the degree to which similarly 
situated applicants have been able to meet these minimum equity commitments. For repeated waiver 
requests for specific lack of eligible persons or eligible contractors available, the Agency will make 
recommendations to target recruitment to add such eligible persons or eligible contractors to the 
[Energy Workforce Equity] database.”  
The Agency will consider an assertive, sincere, and results-oriented action taken by the applicant to 
comply with the minimum equity standards due diligence. The purpose of an entity demonstrating 
due diligence is to promote the support of equitable access to employment on local energy solar 
 
627 In its Final Order approving the 2022 Long-Term Plan, the Commission approved the IPA’s commitment in its Response to Objections 
to adjust the use of the term “minority” in this section, so as to avoid confusion between the characteristics of Equity Eligible Persons 
versus the characteristics traditionally associated with “minority” populations, specifically race and ethnicity, which are not qualifying 
characteristics of EEPs. See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 159; IPA Response at 130.

projects, job training and apprenticeships of the residents of underserved communities throughout 
the State of Illinois. In an instance where full compliance is not attainable, the Agency will accept a 
written, detailed explanation of why the applicant was incapable of contracting an equity eligible 
person or Equity Eligible contractor. Use of the Energy Equity Workforce Database developed by the 
Agency will not alone qualify as sufficient due diligence. The program participant must provide 
copies of all interactions proving such challenges and a signed attestation affirming the information 
provided is truthful accurate and complete. 
Given the breadth of factors at issue in a waiver assessment and the need for transparency of the 
waver evaluation process, the Agency will conduct a stakeholder feedback process to design a more 
detailed waiver application and assessment process. In its Final Order, the ICC directed the Agency 
to assess each waiver request based upon a quantitative scoring system.628 The Agency intends for 
that scoring system to include the criteria enumerated above, with each criterion earning a discrete 
number of points, though it reserves the right to adjust the criteria based on stakeholder feedback 
(excluding any criteria expressed in Section 1-75(c-10) directly). The stakeholder feedback process 
will seek input on both the format of waiver applications and the design of the scoring system for 
waiver approval. The Agency intends to hold that stakeholder process in early 2023, well before the 
Minimum Equity Standard goes into effect on June 1, 2023.  
Inaccuracies,  fraudulent  statements,  or  any  misleading  details  may  result  in  immediate 
disqualification for a waiver and further disciplinary action with IPA programs.  For the Delivery Year 
2023-2024 the Agency will determine waivers on a case-by-case basis due to the potential that there 
may only be a limited number of Equity Eligible Contractors and equity eligible persons while the 
training programs created by P.A. 102-0662 are established. 
10.1.4.  Enforcement of Standards 
If the Agency determines that an Approved Vendor, Designee, or Competitive Procurement Supplier 
has failed to comply with any of the requirements set forth by the Agency, or any contract provision 
set forth by the law, the Agency will notify that entity in writing within twenty-one days. At such time, 
the Agency may request within twenty-one days after the notice of noncompliance any additional 
reports, information and documentation that are reasonably necessary to determine program 
compliance. If the requested materials are not received within twenty-one days, the Agency will 
render a finding of noncompliance, and the appropriate violation status outlined below will apply.  
Requests for an extension for more time to provide such additional information must be made prior 
to the twenty-one day deadline and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
The Agency will impose consequences for violations by program participants due to non-compliance, 
including but not limited to: 
i.  Suspension of the entity’s ability to submit project applications to IPA programs or to 
participate in competitive procurements during the remainder of the delivery year.  
ii.  Repeated violations could potentially result in the Approved Vendor or Designee 
becoming suspended from the IPA’s programs for an entire delivery year. Competitive 
Procurement Suppliers could likewise be barred from participation in future 
competitive procurement events.

Suspensions of an Approved Vendor or Designee in the Adjustable Block Program will be noted on 
the program website’s lists of Approved Vendors and Designees as well listed on the disciplinary 
actions report and in the Energy Workforce Equity Database. 
10.1.5.  Program Recruitment for a Diverse Workforce 
The Agency will seek to collaborate with other State agencies to encourage participating entities to 
utilize a diverse workforce and diverse contractors. Utilization of other State agency resources, such 
as comprehensive databases, will be an option for program participants in need of support in meeting 
the minimum equity standard. 
Approved Vendors, Designees, and Competitive Procurement Suppliers should exercise multiple 
avenues to engage eligible persons, where applicable: 
i.  Workshops to educate the local eligible workforce on industry particulars 
ii.  Offering potential job-shadowing to clean energy program students through DCEO 
workforce hubs, and focusing efforts on targeted audiences629  
iii.  Utilization of the Energy Workforce Equity Database 
iv.  Job fairs for appropriate screening of potential candidates 
v.  Accessing untapped local labor pools (i.e., trade schools, community colleges) 
vi.  Developing tailored training programs to accommodate pre-employment training (i.e., 
life skills, financial management) 
vii.  Special funding for dislocated workers to expand service capability and/or training for 
project work 
viii.  Supporting training and employment retention by connecting with community-based 
organizations for proper wrap around services such as: childcare assistance, 
transportation, and mentor check-ins 
ix.  Providing support to persons or entities who apply for state and federal workforce 
programs or assistance related to clean energy  
10.1.6.  Modifications to the Equity Accountability System 
Section 1-75(c-10)(7) provides that, “[a]s part of the update of the long-term renewable resources 
procurement plan to be initiated in 2023, or sooner if the Agency deems necessary, the Agency shall 
determine the extent to which the equity accountability system… has advanced the goals [codified in 
P.A.  102-0662]  including  through  the  inclusion  of  equity  eligible  persons  and  equity  eligible 
contractors in renewable energy credit projects.”  
If the Agency determines that the equity accountability system has not fully achieved those goals to 
its fullest potential, Section 1-75(c-10)(7) provides that the Agency may revise the following criteria:  
i.  [T]he percentage of project workforce, or other appropriate workforce measure, certified 
as equity eligible persons or equity eligible contractors 
ii.  [T]he definitions for equity investment eligible persons and equity investment eligible 
community 
 
629 In its Final Order approving the 2022 Long-Term Plan, the Commission approved the IPA’s commitment in its Response to Objections 
to adjust the use of the term “minority” in this section, so as to avoid confusion between the characteristics of Equity Eligible Persons 
versus the characteristics traditionally associated with “minority” populations, specifically race and ethnicity, which are not qualifying 
characteristics of EEPs. See Docket No. 22-0231, Final Order dated July 14, 2022 at 159; IPA Response at 130.

iii.  [O]ther modifications deemed necessary to advance the goals of [Public Act 102-0662]. Such 
revised criteria may also establish distinct equity accountability systems for different types 
of procurements or different regions of the State if the Agency finds that doing so will further 
the purposes of such programs.  
Revisions will be developed with stakeholder input, including from Equity Eligible Persons, Equity 
Eligible  Contractors,  and  community-based  organizations  that  work  with  such  persons  and 
contractors. 
10.2.  Equity Accountability System Assessment and Racial Disparity Study 
Section 1-75(c-15) of the IPA Act as amended by Public Act 102-0662 requires the Agency to conduct 
analysis of the effectiveness of the equity accountability system in increasing participation of Equity 
Eligible Persons and Equity Eligible Contractors. The Agency must conduct this analysis within one 
year  of  awarding  the  first  contracts  that  resulted  from  the  implementation  of  the  equity 
accountability system.  
After that initial assessment of the equity accountability system, Section 1-75(c-15)(2)(B) of the IPA 
Act  requires  that  the  Agency  commission  a  study  to  “measure  the  presence  and  impact  of 
discrimination on minority businesses and workers in Illinois' clean energy economy,” including 
activity outside of IPA programs, utilizing consultants and subject matter experts. The study will 
review  the  State’s  renewable  energy  sector  regarding  access,  participation,  and  utilization  of 
contractors,  with  a  special  emphasis  on  minority-owned  business  enterprises  and 
minority/disadvantaged workers, with the goal of analyzing whether race or gender has been a 
barrier to equitable access for all business owners and workers.  
Section 1-75(c-15)(2)(B) of the IPA Act expressly exempts the selection of a consultant to conduct 
this study from the bidding requirements contained in Section 20-10 of the Illinois Procurement 
Code. Like other selection processes for consultants conducted by the Agency that are exempt from 
those requirements (e.g., Procurement Administrators, Procurement Planning Consultants, and 
Program Administrators), this process will be conducted in two parts consisting of an initial Request 
for Qualifications and a subsequent Request for Proposals issued to qualified respondents to the 
Request for Qualifications. The Agency will also consult relevant professionals experienced with the 
use and design of disparity studies and the legal considerations of race-conscience remedies prior to 
the selection of a consultant and will endeavor to have the consultant selected by June 1, 2023. This 
will allow the consultant to be in place at the time of the launch of the Equity Accountability System 
which will be a critical data input into the study. 
10.2.1.  Timing of Equity Accountability System Assessment and Racial 
Disparity Study 
Section 1-75(c-15)(2)(A) sets the timeline for publishing the assessment findings to be within one 
year after contracts are awarded under the equity accountability system. The system launches June 
1, 2023 and there will be some lag between that date and the first contracts awarded. Therefore, the 
Agency aims to publish the initial study  by August 1, 2024. The Agency will publish the findings of 
all research listed above, along with recommendations made to the Agency regarding inclusion of 
minority  and  disadvantaged  businesses  in  the  procurement  process.  The  report  will  display 
participating workers and contractors by race and ethnicity, with all data anonymized.

Section 1-75(c-15)(2)(B) provides that the Agency shall commission the disparity study “as soon as 
is practicable” after publishing the assessment of the equity accountability system. The Agency will 
work with DCEO to develop a timeline for commissioning this study.  
10.2.2.  Scope of Equity Accountability System Assessment and Racial 
Disparity Study 
The methodology used to assist the Agency with assessing the efficacy of the equity accountability 
system will include, but will not be limited to, the following: 
i.  Analysis of data collected by the Agency through its programs, procurements, and Equity 
Accountability System 
ii.  Interviews with area and regional businesses 
iii.  Community  outreach  to  include  townhall  meetings,  email  correspondence,  and  public 
hearings open to the public for transparency 
iv.  Focused assembly of randomly chosen EEC business owners to articulate their experiences 
in doing business in the industry with the State of Illinois 
The methodology of the disparity study will be determined by the consulting firm retained by the 
Agency to conduct the study. 
10.2.3.  Coordination with Other Agencies 
The Agency will collaborate closely with the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, 
Department of Labor, Department of Corrections, and other appropriate agencies to commission the 
racial disparity study. The primary objective of inter-agency coordination will be to develop actions 
to effectively address discriminatory practices or trends in the clean energy sector in Illinois.   
10.2.4.  Entity Participation 
A critical element of a successful disparity study is a representative set of data to obtain a true 
reflection of the state of inequitable practices and procedures. Specifically, minority-owned business 
and worker participation would provide valuable insight to the efficacy and challenges in the 
Agency’s  efforts  to  increase  inclusion  and  may  highlight  previously  unknown  barriers  to 
participation. Substantive input from diverse entities will inform changes to policies, procedures, and 
procurements going forward.  
The Agency will collaborate with the entity contracted to conduct the disparity study to create 
scheduled  public  workshops  to  collect  stakeholder  input.  Entities  not  comfortable  sharing 
experiences in a public setting or unable to attend will have the option of sharing experiences via 
written communication. 
As discussed above, the Agency sets a tentative completion and publication date for the study of 
August 1, 2024. The tentative date will be subject to change according to Agency response to future 
statutory requirements. 
10.3.  Program Data Collection  
Section 1-75(c-20) acknowledges that “data collection, data analysis, and reporting are critical to 
ensure that the benefits of the clean energy economy provided to Illinois residents and businesses 
are equitably distributed across the State,” and for “track[ing] and improv[ing] equitable distribution

338,346,"Illinois Power Agency  2022 Long-Term Plan (Final)  August 23, 2022 
   
of benefits across Illinois communities.” It directs the Agency to collect certain data from all entities 
participating in Agency programs so that the Agency may monitor the progress in advancing access 
to and participation in renewable energy incentive programs by diverse businesses and residents.  
The Agency will collect demographic and geographic data for each entity awarded contracts under 
any Agency-administered program: 
i.  Demographic information, including racial or ethnic identity for real persons employed, 
contracted, or subcontracted through the program and owners of businesses or entities 
that receive contracts through Agency programs or procurements 
ii.  Geographic  location  of  the  residency  of  real  persons  employed,  contracted,  or 
subcontracted through the program and geographic location of the headquarters of the 
business or entity is awarded a contract through an Agency program or procurement; and  
iii.  Any other information the Agency determines is necessary for the purpose of achieving 
the purpose of this subsection.  
The Agency will provide stakeholders the opportunity to review proposals and provide feedback 
before any new information requirements are implemented. As required by Section 1-75(c-20)(4), 
the Agency will “publish … annually, information on the demographics of program participants on an 
aggregate basis.” 
10.4.  Energy Workforce Equity Database 
Section 1-75(c-25) requires that the Agency develop an Energy Workforce Equity Database. As of the 
filing this final 2022 Long-Term Plan, which has been updated to reflect the Commission’s Final Order 
approving  the  Plan,  the  Agency  is  collaborating  with  other  state  agencies  to  expedite  the 
development of this tool.630 This online resource will allow users to view the participating businesses 
in the renewable energy industry of Illinois. Participating entities will have additional responsibility 
for compiling and submitting relevant information on Equity Eligible Contractors and Equity Eligible 
Persons. 
Section 1-75(c-25)(1) of the IPA Act states that: 
The Energy Workforce Equity Database shall be a searchable database of suppliers, 
vendors, and subcontractors for clean energy industries that is: 
   (A) publicly accessible 
   (B) easy for people to find and use 
   (C) organized by company specialty or field 
   (D) region-specific and 
   (E) populated with information including, but not limited to, contacts for suppliers, 
vendors, or subcontractors who are minority and women-owned business enterprise 
certified or who participate or have participated in any of the programs described in 
this Act. 
 
630 In the event of a selection of an outside contractor to conduct the web design, such selection would be exempt from the bid selection 
process requirements of Section 20-10 of the Illinois Procurement Code.

Sections 1-75(c-25)(2) and (3) further specifies that:     
(2) The Agency shall create an easily accessible, public facing online tool using the 
database information that includes, at a minimum, the following: 
 (A) a map of environmental justice and equity investment eligible communities 
 (B) job postings and recruiting opportunities 
 (C) a means by which recruiting clean energy companies can find and interact 
with  current  or  former  participants  of  clean  energy  workforce  training 
programs 
 (D)  information  on  workforce  training  service  providers  and  training 
opportunities available to prospective workers 
 (E) renewable energy company diversity reporting 
 (F) a list of equity eligible contractors with their contact information, types of 
work performed, and locations worked in 
 (G)  reporting  on  outcomes  of  the  programs  described  in  the  workforce 
programs of the Energy Transition Act, including information such as, but not 
limited to, retention rate, graduation rate, and placement rates of trainees; and 
 (H) information about the Jobs and Environmental Justice Grant Program, the 
Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund, and other sources of capital. 
        (3)  The  Agency  shall  ensure  the  database  is  regularly  updated  to  ensure 
information is current and shall coordinate with the Department of Commerce and 
Economic Opportunity to ensure that it includes information on individuals and 
entities that are or have participated in the Clean Jobs Workforce Network Program, 
Clean  Energy  Contractor  Incubator  Program,  Returning  Residents  Clean  Jobs 
Training Program, or Clean Energy Primes Contractor Accelerator Program.  
The Database will enable individuals to register as Equity Eligible Persons and seek job opportunities 
and will allow for those individuals to identify themselves as Qualified Persons for purposes of 
renewable energy installation. 631 
The Agency notes that while some of the information required for the database already exists (e.g., 
maps of environmental justice communities), many other data sources do not yet exist. For example, 
the new workforce development and grant programs administered by the Department of Commerce 
and Economic Opportunity are still under development. For this reason, the Agency is planning a 
phased rollout of the Energy Equity Workforce Database.  
 The Agency expects that Phase 1 of the Energy Equity Workforce Database will be launched by late 
2022.  Phase 2 will begin 1st quarter 2023, in conjunction with the Department of Commerce and 
Economic Opportunity, and include information required by items D through H of Section 1-75(c-
25(2).
