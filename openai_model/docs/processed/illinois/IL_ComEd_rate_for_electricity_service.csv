Each year after the initial implementation of the RTOU Electricity Charges, the RTOU Electricity 
Charges are updated and will be applicable beginning with that year’s June monthly billing period and 
extending through the following May monthly billing period.  RTOU Electricity Charges are also 
updated when Capacity Costs are determined to be different than the Capacity Costs included in the 
then-effective RTOU Electricity Charges.  Moreover, the RTOU Electricity Charges may be revised by 
the Company if the Company determines such revision results in a better match between the 
Company’s applicable expected costs and its recovery of those costs.  
 
RTOU Electricity Charges are applicable to each kWh provided to the retail customer during the 
corresponding RTOU Super Peak Period, Peak Period or Off Peak Period in the summer or 
nonsummer monthly billing period for which such charge is determined.  Each such summer and 
nonsummer RTOU SPPEC, PPEC and OPPEC is determined in the following three steps and 
formulas: (1) the first step, Formula 1, determines the residential energy charge per kWh that would 
have been recovered with the historical PJM real time residual locational marginal prices for the 
ComEd Zone and distribution losses for the participants’ aggregate illustrative profile for each of the 
summer and nonsummer price periods, (2) the second step, Formula 2, determines the per kWh 
capacity costs by allocating 91.5% of the Capacity Costs to the Super Peak Period and 8.5% of the 
Capacity Costs to the Peak Period and dividing by the corresponding kWh for each period, and (3) the 
third step, Formula 3, sums the corresponding per kWh energy charges and capacity charges and 
adds any associated per kWh adjustments for each period, converts the charges to cents/kWh and 
applies the uncollectible factors to determine the resultant charge: 
 
 
Formula 1: 
 
HENC  = (∑End Hour [HkW x HLMP] x  1 MWh  x (1+DLF))/kWh   
P S or N Start Hour 1,000 kWh P S or N
 
 
Formula 2: 
 
ECC(Super Peak) = (Capacity Costs x 0.915)/E(Super Peak)  
 
ECC(Peak) = (Capacity Costs x 0.085)/E(Peak) 
 
 
 
 
Formula 3: 
 
RTOUEC  =  (HENC  + ECC  +A ) x 100ȼ/$ x SBUF x ISUF

  RTOU PJM Services Charge 
The RTOU PJM Services Charge is applicable to each kWh provided to the retail customer during the 
monthly billing period.  The application of the RTOU PJM Services Charge allows the Company to 
recover from retail customers receiving electric service with RTOU pricing the costs it incurs in 
procuring certain services from PJM, including but not limited to, NITS and other PJM-associated 
expenses incurred in accordance with applicable tariffs on file with the FERC, and other applicable 
law.  The Company is not allowed to mark-up or include a return on such costs.  Such services are the 
same as those procured in accordance with the provisions of the PJM Services Price section of Rider 
PE - Purchased Electricity (Rider PE).  The RTOU PJM Services Charge is developed using the 
electricity usage expected to be provided to retail customers receiving electric service under the 
provisions of this tariff for a period of twelve (12) monthly billing periods extending from the start of a 
June monthly billing period and through the following May monthly billing period.  The RTOU PJM 
Services Charge is shown as a separate line item on the retail customer's monthly bill for electric 
service and designated as the Transmission Services Charge. 
 
  The RTOU PJM Services Charge is determined by the Company each year and is generally applicable 
for the period that extends from the beginning of the June monthly billing period through the end of the 
following May monthly billing period.  Included in the determination of the PJM Services Charge are 
applicable system losses, base uncollectible costs, and incremental uncollectible costs incurred by the 
Company.

RTOU Miscellaneous Procurement Components Charge 
The RTOU MPCC is applicable to each kWh provided to the retail customer during the monthly billing 
period.  The Company determines a RTOU MPCC in a manner that allows the Company to recover 
the costs it incurs related to the procurement of electric power and energy directly from PJM-
administered markets for retail customers receiving electric service with RTOU pricing which are not 
recovered through the application of the RTOU Electricity Charges and the RTOU PJM Services 
Charge. 
 
  The RTOU MPCC is determined by the Company each year and is generally applicable for the period 
that extends from the beginning of the June monthly billing period through the end of the following May 
monthly billing period.  The following costs expected to be incurred by the Company may be included 
in the determination of the RTOU MPCC:  
 
(a) base and incremental uncollectible costs;  
 
(b) customer service related costs allocated to only retail customers taking service hereunder in 
accordance with the ICC’s order in the Company’s most recent rate or Rate DSPP - Delivery 
Service Pricing and Performance (Rate DSPP) annual update case, as applicable;  
 
(c)  collection agency costs allocated to only retail customers taking service hereunder in accordance 
with the ICC’s order in the Company’s most recent rate or Rate DSPP annual update case, as 
applicable; 
 
(d) costs of working capital used to arrange or procure electric power and energy directly from PJM-
administered markets, with such costs determined in a manner consistent with the methodology 
used to determine costs of working capital approved by the ICC in its order in the Company’s most 
recent rate or Rate DSPP annual update case, or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable; and   
    
(e) costs associated with arranging or procuring electric power and energy directly from PJM-
administered markets, which are identified through the use of a wages and salaries allocator 
calculated as initially directed by the ICC in its Order in Docket No. 11-0721, dated May 29, 2012, 
with any subsequent value of such allocator as approved by the ICC in its order in the Company’s 
most recent rate or Rate DSPP annual update case, or as otherwise provided by law, as 
applicable, and taking into account reconciliation adjustments made in accordance with Section 
16-108.5(d) of the Act, as applicable, whereby such costs are equal to the portion of the 
Company’s overall costs to which such allocator is applied that are (i) not recovered through the 
application of delivery service charges, (ii) not recovered through the application of the RTOU PJM 
Services Charge determined in accordance with the RTOU PJM Services Charge subsection of

Including costs of working capital in the determination of the RTOU MPCC provides for the recovery of 
costs the Company incurs for working capital used to arrange or procure electric power and energy 
supply directly from PJM-administered markets, such as the funds required to finance the lag between 
the purchase of electric power and energy supply resources and the recovery of the costs of such 
resources from retail customers.  Such costs are determined in a manner consistent with the 
methodology used to determine costs of working capital approved by the ICC in its order in the 
Company’s most recent rate or Rate DSPP annual update case, or as otherwise provided by law, as 
applicable.  Such methodology is applied using a cost of capital equal to that established by the ICC in 
its order in such most recent case or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable.  All other data, 
including applicable leads and lags, are updated annually to reflect current electric power and energy 
supply procurement working capital costs.  Company representatives must review such calculated 
costs with personnel from the Accounting Department of the ICC Staff in accordance with the 
provisions of the Reporting and Annual Audit section of this tariff.  A cost of capital established by the 
ICC in its order in such most recent case or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable, is applied in 
determining the costs of working capital component of the RTOU MPCC only for RTOU MPCCs that 
become applicable after the date of such order or law, as applicable. 
 
Applicable system losses are reflected in the determination of the RTOU MPCC.  Notwithstanding the 
previous provisions of this RTOU MPCC subsection, the RTOU MPCC must be recomputed in 
accordance with directives in ICC orders in Company rate or Rate DSPP annual update cases, or as 
otherwise provided by law, as applicable.  Moreover, the RTOU MPCC must be recomputed in the 
event that the Company revises base uncollectible costs or incremental uncollectible costs included in 
the determination of the RTOU MPCC.  In the event that the Company revises the RTOU PJM 
Services Charge in accordance with the provisions in the RTOU PJM Services Charge subsection of 
this Monthly Charges section, or at such time that FERC approved or accepted changes in charges 
related to costs recovered through the application of the RTOU MPCC become effective, the RTOU 
MPCC for service under this tariff may be required to be correspondingly revised. 
 
RTOU Purchased Electricity Adjustment Factor  
The RTOU Purchased Electricity Adjustment Factor (RTOU PEA) periodically equalizes the revenues 
from retail customers receiving electric service under this tariff for electric power and energy procured 
for them by the Company and the expenses incurred by the Company related to the procurement of 
such electric power and energy as provided in this Monthly Charges section.

CUSTOMER INFORMATION. 
Customers enrolled under Rate RTOUPP will receive scheduled reporting that generally shows how their 
bills compare to what bills under Rate BES would have been. 
 
  REPORTING AND ANNUAL AUDIT. 
Each year beginning in 2021, if sufficient data exists, at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the start of 
the June monthly billing period, internal administrative and operational costs and costs of working capital 
expected to be incurred by the Company as a result of its electric power and energy supply procurement 
activities for retail customers for which the Company is to provide service hereunder during the PJM 
Planning Period beginning on the June 1 corresponding to such June monthly billing period must be 
reviewed by Company representatives with personnel from the Accounting Department of the ICC Staff. 
 
Each year beginning in 2021, if sufficient data exists, the Company must conduct an audit of its costs for 
the previous PJM Planning Year and recoveries of such costs pursuant to this tariff.  The Company must 
also prepare a report each year that summarizes the results of such audit.  Such report must be submitted 
to the ICC in an informational filing, with copies of such report provided to the Manager of the Staff's 
Accounting Department and the Director of the Staff's Financial Analysis Division within sixty (60) calendar 
days after the end of the effective period associated with the May determination period of such PJM 
Planning Year.  Such report must be verified by an officer of the Company. 
 
The audit described in the previous paragraph of this Reporting and Annual Audit section must examine 
(a) costs recovered pursuant to this tariff to verify that such costs are recovered only pursuant to this tariff 
and to confirm that any such costs are not also being recovered inappropriately through charges imposed 
under other tariffs, (b) charges and adjustments determined pursuant to this tariff that are included in retail 
customers' bills for electric service provided hereunder to verify that such charges and adjustments are 
properly applied, (c) revenues resulting from the application of this tariff to verify that such revenues are 
correctly stated, (d) the Company's internal administrative and operational costs associated with the 
procurement of electric power and energy for retail customers served hereunder to verify that such costs 
are reasonable, and (e) the Company’s costs of working capital associated with expenditures for electric 
power and energy supply to ensure such costs were determined in a manner consistent with the 
methodology used to determine costs of working capital approved by the ICC in its order in the then most 
recent rate or Rate DSPP annual update case, or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable, using the 
cost of capital established by the ICC in its order in such most recent case or as otherwise provided by

  ANNUAL RECONCILIATION. 
Each year beginning in 2021, if sufficient data exists, no earlier than ninety (90) calendar days after the 
end of the effective period associated with the May determination period of a PJM Planning Year and 
concurrent with the annual reconciliation filings for Rate BESH and Rider PE, a proceeding must 
commence to provide for the correction of any errors that may have occurred in the application of the 
provisions of this tariff.  Any such proceeding may also provide for the determination of the 
reasonableness of the Company's internal administrative and operational costs associated with the 
procurement of electric power and energy for retail customers served hereunder.  With respect to the costs 
of working capital incurred by the Company, the actual costs of working capital must be calculated based 
upon a methodology consistent with the methodology used to determine costs of working capital approved 
by the ICC in its order in the then most recent rate or Rate DSPP annual update case, or as otherwise 
provided by law, as applicable.  The actual costs of working capital must be calculated based upon the 
cost of capital established by the ICC in its order in such most recent case or as otherwise provided by 
law, as applicable using actual expenses to arrange or procure electric power and energy directly from 
PJM-administered markets and applicable updated lead and lag days.  Such calculated costs of working 
capital are subject to review and adjustment in the annual proceeding described in this Annual 
Reconciliation section.  To the extent that any such error is identified or any such reviewable cost is found 
to be unreasonable by the ICC, an applicable adjustment is determined and applied in accordance with 
lawful orders issued by the ICC in such proceeding and effectuated through the Adjustment (A) component 
of the TOU PEA in accordance with the provisions of the RTOU Purchased Electricity Adjustment Factor 
subsection of the Monthly Charges section of this tariff.

*  PJM Services Charge 
The PJM Services Charge is applicable to each kWh provided to the retail customer during the 
monthly billing period.  The application of the PJM Services Charge allows the Company to recover 
from retail customers receiving electric service with hourly pricing the costs it incurs in procuring 
certain services from PJM, including but not limited to, NITS and other PJM-associated expenses 
incurred in accordance with applicable tariffs on file with the FERC, and other applicable law.  The 
Company is not allowed to mark-up or include a return on such costs.  Such services are the same as 
those procured in accordance with the provisions of the PJM Services Price section of Rider PE - 
Purchased Electricity (Rider PE).  The PJM Services Charge is developed using the electricity usage 
expected to be provided to retail customers receiving electric service with hourly pricing for a period of 
twelve (12) monthly billing periods extending from the start of a June monthly billing period and 
through the following May monthly billing period.  The PJM Services Charge is shown as a separate 
line item on the retail customer's monthly bill for electric service and designated as the Transmission 
Services Charge. 
 
  The PJM Services Charge is determined by the Company each year and is generally applicable for the 
period that extends from the beginning of the June monthly billing period through the end of the 
following May monthly billing period.  Included in the determination of the PJM Services Charge are 
applicable system losses, base uncollectible costs, and incremental uncollectible costs incurred by the 
Company.   
 
Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this PJM Services Charge subsection, in the event that the 
Company (a) recomputes the PJM Services Price (PSP) and revises the Retail PJM Services Charge 
in accordance with the provisions of Rider PE or (b) revises base uncollectible costs or incremental 
uncollectible costs included in the determination of the PJM Services Charge, then the PJM Services 
Charge for service with hourly pricing must be correspondingly revised.  
 
Miscellaneous Procurement Components Charge 
The Miscellaneous Procurement Components Charge is applicable to each kWh provided to the retail 
customer during the monthly billing period.  The Company determines a Miscellaneous Procurement 
Components Charge in a manner that allows the Company to recover the costs it incurs related to the 
procurement of electric power and energy directly from PJM-administered markets for retail customers 
receiving electric service with hourly pricing which are not recovered through the application of the 
MCC, the HECs, and the PJM Services Charge.

Including costs of working capital in the determination of the Miscellaneous Procurement Components 
Charge provides for the recovery of costs the Company incurs for working capital used to arrange or 
procure electric power and energy supply directly from PJM-administered markets, such as the funds 
required to finance the lag between the purchase of electric power and energy supply resources and 
the recovery of the costs of such resources from retail customers.  Such costs are determined in a 
manner consistent with the methodology used to determine costs of working capital approved by the 
ICC in its order in the Company’s most recent rate or Rate DSPP annual update case, or as otherwise 
provided by law, as applicable.  Such methodology is applied using a cost of capital equal to that 
established by the ICC in its order in such most recent case or as otherwise provided by law, as 
applicable.  All other data, including applicable leads and lags, are updated annually to reflect current 
electric power and energy supply procurement working capital costs.  Company representatives must 
review such calculated costs with personnel from the Accounting Department of the ICC Staff in 
accordance with the provisions of the Reporting and Annual Audit section of this tariff.  A cost of 
capital established by the ICC in its order in such most recent case or as otherwise provided by law, 
as applicable, is applied in determining the costs of working capital component of the Miscellaneous 
Procurement Components Charge only for Miscellaneous Procurement Components Charges that 
become applicable after the date of such order or law, as applicable. 
 
Applicable system losses are reflected in the determination of the Miscellaneous Procurement 
Components Charge.  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Miscellaneous Procurement 
Components Charge subsection, the Miscellaneous Procurement Components Charge must be 
recomputed in accordance with directives in ICC orders in Company rate or Rate DSPP annual update 
cases, or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable.  Moreover, the Miscellaneous Procurement 
Components Charge must be recomputed in the event that the Company revises base uncollectible 
costs or incremental uncollectible costs included in the determination of the Miscellaneous 
Procurement Components Charge.  In the event that the Company revises the PJM Services Charge 
in accordance with the provisions in the PJM Services Charge subsection of this Monthly Charges 
section, or at such time that FERC approved or accepted changes in charges related to costs 
recovered through the application of the Miscellaneous Procurement Components Charge become 
effective, the Miscellaneous Procurement Components Charge for service with hourly pricing may be 
required to be correspondingly revised. 
 
Hourly Purchased Electricity Adjustment Factor  
The HPEA periodically equalizes the revenues from retail customers receiving electric service with 
hourly pricing for electric power and energy procured for them by the Company and the expenses 
incurred by the Company related to the procurement of such electric power and energy.

and (b) does not elect to obtain service from the Company under any other tariffed service at its premises 
due to the fact that such retail customer is vacating the premises, service hereunder continues for not 
more than ten (10) days after the date such retail customer vacates the premises, provided the retail

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Delivery Service section, transmission, ancillary 
transmission, and/or related services may be provided by a provider, other than the Company, on 
transmission facilities located in the Company’s service territory, in connection with a transaction under 
this tariff if:  (a) applicable tariffs on file with the FERC governing the provision of such services on the 
transmission facilities located in the Company’s service territory allow for or require the provision of such 
services by such other provider, and (b) those services are provided at the same rates, terms, and 
conditions as are provided in such tariffs. 
 
  The Company delivers electric power and energy to retail customers and retail customers take and pay for 
such delivery in accordance with the provisions of this tariff, the General Terms and Conditions of the 
Company’s Schedule of Rates, and such other tariffs as are applicable to the services being provided.  
Such delivery is made for electric power and energy that are (a) supplied to retail customers by RESs that 
are taking service under the Company’s Rate RESS - Retail Electric Supplier Service (Rate RESS), (b) 
supplied to retail customers by RESs for retail customers identified as Customer Self-Managers (CSMs) in 
accordance with the provisions of the Types of Customers section of the Service Options part of this tariff, 
and (c) supplied to retail customers by the Company in accordance with the provisions of Rider PPO - 
Power Purchase Option (Rider PPO). 
 
In accordance with federal law and FERC determinations, the Company’s obligation to provide or arrange 
for the provision of certain components of delivery service, which includes the procurement and 
arrangement for the procurement of federal-jurisdictional services for itself and its retail customers, is met 
through its membership in PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM).  The delivery service components so 
provided are taken hereunder at the same rates and subject to the same terms, conditions, and limitations 
as are authorized by the FERC and the Company is not liable for the performance, representations, 
actions, or omissions of PJM. 
 
In the event that the Company no longer owns transmission facilities or no longer is obligated by the FERC 
to provide transmission services or ancillary transmission services, then the Company's obligation to 
provide or arrange for the provision of such delivery service components terminates. 
 
RELATIONSHIP OF THE RETAIL CUSTOMER, RES, AND THE COMPANY. 
The retail customer purchases delivery service from the Company under this tariff and other applicable 
tariffs of the Company.  RESs sell electric power and energy supply service to the retail customer pursuant 
to contractual arrangements that are not part of the Company’s tariffs.  The Company is not a party to 
such sales of electric power and energy supply service to the retail customer taking service hereunder and 
is not bound by any term, condition, or provision of agreement for such sales.  RESs are not agents of the 
Company and have no authority to enter into any agreement on behalf of the Company or to amend, 
modify, or alter any of the Company’s tariffs, contracts, or procedures, or to bind the Company by making 
any promises, representations, or omissions.  The Company is not liable for any act, omission, promise, or 
representation of any RES that takes service under Rate RESS or that provides or promises or represents 
that it will provide electric power and energy supply service in the Company’s service territory.

TYPES OF CUSTOMERS. 
Customer Self-Managers 
A Customer Self-Manager (CSM) manages directly its own supply of electric power and energy and 
use of transmission services and ancillary transmission services, and submits its own Direct Access 
Service Requests (DASRs), rather than utilizing a RES for such purposes.  A nonresidential retail 
customer may act as a CSM if it (a) has reasonable expectation that it will cause at least one 
megawatt (1 MW) to be delivered hereunder in each of at least ninety percent (90%) of the hours in 
the twelve (12) consecutive monthly billing periods following its designation as a CSM and in each 
subsequent twelve (12) consecutive monthly billing periods, absent a force majeure as defined in any 
applicable tariff on file with the FERC governing transactions over the transmission facilities located in 
the Company’s service territory, with such amount to be for one premises or multiple premises at 
which the CSM is the Company’s retail customer; (b) has the ability to procure, and procures, its 
transmission services and ancillary transmission services under each applicable tariff on file with the 
FERC governing the transmission of electric power and energy to and within the Company’s service 
territory; (c) demonstrates through the successful completion of the Company’s testing program, and 
maintains, the ability to electronically transmit DASRs to the Company, electronically receive metering 
data from the Company, and electronically send and receive any other applicable information 
transmissions to and from the Company; (d) executes an agreement with the Company to act as a 
CSM as provided herein; and (e) qualifies as an Eligible Customer under the provisions of the PJM 
Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT), or any successor thereto.  The CSM is responsible for the 
obligations described in the Technical and Operational Provisions part of this tariff for all retail 
customer premises for which it is the CSM.  The CSM submits DASRs, as applicable, for all retail 
customer premises for which it is the CSM.  The CSM is responsible for complying with all applicable 
PJM regulations and business practices. 
 
A CSM may employ a qualified agent other than a RES taking service under Rate RESS to arrange for 
transmission services and ancillary transmission services in the CSM’s name and on behalf of the 
CSM insofar as such employment is permitted under applicable tariffs on file with the FERC.  Such 
CSM must notify the Company and PJM, in writing, of the identity of the agent at least three (3) 
business days prior to the agent arranging for such services on behalf of the CSM.  The agent cannot 
take any action that causes the CSM to be in violation of this tariff, any other applicable tariff on file 
with the ICC or the FERC, or any contract between the Company and the CSM.  The CSM is 
responsible for each act the agent takes in the CSM’s name, regardless of whether or not such act 
was authorized by the CSM.  Employing an agent does not relieve the CSM of any obligation under 
this tariff or any other applicable tariff or contract.

Retail Customers Taking Service Under Rider PPO 
A retail customer for which directly procured electric power and energy supply is provided by the 
Company under Rider PPO procures all applicable transmission services and ancillary transmission 
services through the Company for such supply provided under the terms of Rider PPO.  The Company 
is responsible for the obligations, as applicable, described in the Technical and Operational Provisions 
part of this tariff for such retail customer.  The Company submits DASRs, as applicable, for such retail 
customer. 
 
All Other Retail Customers Served Hereunder 
A retail customer taking service hereunder that is not a CSM, and is not taking service under Rider 
PPO, manages its supply of electric power and energy and use of transmission services and ancillary 
transmission services for the electric power and energy delivered hereunder through a RES subject to 
Rate RESS, and designated by such retail customer in accordance with the terms of this tariff and 
Rate RESS.  Such RES arranges for all applicable transmission services and ancillary transmission 
services on behalf of such retail customer under each applicable tariff on file with the FERC.  Such 
RES, along with the retail customer, is responsible for certain obligations with respect to such retail 
customer, including the obligations included in the Technical and Operational Provisions part of this 
tariff.  Such RES also has the obligation to pay on behalf of the retail customer for certain components 
of delivery service, as provided in Rate RESS.  The RES submits DASRs, as applicable, for such retail 
customer. 
 
By designating a RES for the purposes described in the preceding paragraph, the retail customer 
authorizes the Company to transfer to such designated RES all such retail customer’s meter and 
billing data for the electric power and energy supply service provided to such retail customer by such 
designated RES. 
 
By taking delivery service and purchasing electric power and energy supply service from a RES 
served under Rate RESS, the retail customer also authorizes such RES, on such retail customer’s 
behalf, to arrange for transmission services and ancillary transmission services to be used by the retail

accordance with the terms and conditions of Rate MSPS, other applicable tariffs of the Company,

or alter any of the Company’s tariffs, contracts, or procedures, or to bind the Company by making 
any promises, representations, or omissions.  The Company is not liable for any act, omission, 
promise, or representation of any MSP that takes service under Rate MSPS or that provides or 
promises or represents that it will provide Metering Service in the Company’s service territory.

Term of Service and Termination 
This Alternative Metering Service subsection continues to be applicable to a retail customer taking 
service under this tariff as long as such retail customer obtains Metering Service from an MSP

If the Company determines that Rate MSPS is no longer applicable or available to the MSP, if the 
MSP ceases to be an MSP, if the Company terminates Rate MSPS service to the MSP, or if the 
MSP is no longer providing Metering Service to individual retail customers, the Company notifies 
such retail customer that had been provided Metering Service from such MSP that such MSP is no 
longer providing or is not qualified to provide Metering Service.  In such circumstances, such retail 
customer is provided with metering service by the Company under the provisions of the Company-
Provided Metering Service subsection of this Metering Facilities section, and this Alternative 
Metering Service subsection is not applicable to such retail customer.  
 
Other Conditions for Alternative Metering Service 
The Company reserves the right to perform emergency disconnection of electric service to the 
retail customer at the request of fire or law enforcement agencies or in the event the Company is 
otherwise notified of imminent physical danger to such retail customer’s premises, structures or 
facilities located at such premises, or individuals located at such premises, and the disconnection 
of electric service is necessary to alleviate such danger. 
 
The Company reserves the right to perform emergency action that may require the removal or

TERM OF SERVICE AND TERMINATION (CONTINUED). 
If the Company determines that Rate RESS is no longer available to a RES, if the RES ceases to be a 
RES, if the Company terminates Rate RESS service to a RES, or if the RES is no longer providing electric 
power and energy supply service to individual retail customers, the Company notifies such retail 
customers that had been provided electric power and energy supply service from such RES that such RES 
is no longer providing or is not qualified to provide electric power and energy supply service.  Such retail 
customers are switched to service provided under an applicable tariff for bundled electric service as of the 
time of the discontinuance of service to the RES. 
 
Special Provisions Applicable to CSMs 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous paragraph, service hereunder to a CSM is not altered in 
the situations therein described if such CSM seamlessly procures electric power and energy supply 
service from a different RES that is taking service under Rate RESS or to which Rate RESS is 
available.  However, if a CSM is not able to procure such electric power and energy supply service 
from a different RES in such seamless manner, the retail customer’s CSM status is terminated and the 
retail customer is switched to an applicable tariff for bundled electric service. 
 
A CSM has the right to terminate its status as a CSM at any time on no less than sixty (60) days 
written notice to the Company provided such CSM submits a valid and applicable Drop DASR in 
accordance with the Company’s standard procedures for DASR submissions for each retail customer 
premises for which it has heretofore been managing electric power and energy supply service.  The 
Drop DASR for each such retail customer must be submitted in accordance with the Standard 
Switching subsection of the Switching Suppliers section of this Switching Suppliers and Switching to 
Bundled Electric Service part. 
 
In addition to the Company’s other rights to discontinue service to a retail customer, the Company has 
the right to discontinue serving any retail customer for which a CSM has heretofore been managing 
electric power and energy supply service if such CSM fails to perform any of the following obligations, 
and such failure continues for a period of forty-eight (48) hours after such CSM is sent written notice 
by the Company of such failure:  (a) for a CSM that owns or operates an electric generating facility that 
is directly connected to the electric delivery system located in the Company’s service territory, failure 
to abide by all the terms and conditions of any applicable interconnection agreement; (b) violation of 
any rate, term, or condition of applicable tariffs on file with the FERC governing transactions over the 
transmission facilities located in the Company’s service territory; or (c) violation of any term or 
condition of its contracts with the Company for which termination of CSM status is authorized with a 
notice of forty-eight (48) hours.

and energy requirements exceed its supply and there is a shortage of electric power and energy to serve 
the demand for electricity within the Company’s service territory, the retail customer must reimburse the 
Company for the costs which the Company incurs by reason of the retail customer’s failure.  The 
provisions of this paragraph apply directly to CSMs.  The provisions of this paragraph apply to the 
Company for retail customers taking service under Rider PPO.  The provisions of this paragraph for all

To the extent that the Company receives properly submitted DASRs, and acts in accordance with such 
DASRs, the Company is not liable for any conflict such actions may cause between a RES and a retail 
customer or an MSP and a retail customer. 
 
The Company’s Schedule of Rates, of which this tariff is a part, includes General Terms and Conditions

Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this paragraph, for a situation in which a retail customer is 
established as a result of a change in identification for federal tax purposes due to the sale, merger, 
change in corporate form, or bankruptcy of an entity at a premises and the RES is to provide electric 
power and energy supply service to such retail customer, as described in the Availability part of Rate RDS, 
the RES must electronically submit to the Company an Authorization for Continued Service for such retail 
customer in accordance with the provisions of the Prerequisites of Service section of the Application for 
and Commencement of Service part of Rate RDS.  The RES must warrant to the Company that it expends 
its best efforts to submit DASRs and Authorizations for Continued Service, as applicable, only for retail 
customers eligible for Rate RDS. 
 
Any DASR submitted to the Company by a RES taking service hereunder that informs the Company of the 
termination of the provision of electric power and energy supply service by such RES for any retail 
customer for which the RES has been providing electric power and energy supply service, must be 
submitted in accordance with the Standard Switching subsection of the Switching Suppliers section of the 
Switching Suppliers and Switching to Bundled Electric Service part of Rate RDS.  Such DASR is 
designated as a Drop DASR.

MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
In the event the Company or PJM cannot deliver the RES’s electric power and energy supply service to 
the retail customers served by such RES due to an event in which the combined requirements of all 
transmission services commitments exceed the available transfer capability of the transmission system, 
transmission services are curtailed in accordance with applicable curtailment procedures. 
 
In the event that the RES fails to interrupt or curtail the demand of the retail customers for which it is 
providing electric power and energy supply service or increase its supply of electric power and energy in 
conformance with a directive by the Company or PJM for a situation in which the RES’s retail customers’ 
demands exceed its supply and there is a shortage of capacity to serve the demand for electricity within 
the Company’s service territory, the RES must reimburse the Company for the costs which the Company 
incurs by reason of the RES’s failure. 
 
  Retail customers may experience service interruptions due to outages on the electric delivery system 
located in the Company’s service territory.  The Company may provide certain information about outages 
to RESs and others.  As applicable, it is the responsibility of each RES to verify whether or not the retail 
customers for which such RES provides electric power and energy supply service are actually receiving 
electric power and energy, and to adjust data provided to PJM accordingly.  Under no circumstances is the 
Company responsible for identifying to a RES any individual retail customer experiencing a service 
interruption.  
 
The Company is not liable for any act, omission, promise, or representation of any RES that takes service 
hereunder or that provides or promises or represents that it will provide electric power and energy supply 
service in the Company’s service territory.  The Company is not liable for any act, omission, promise, or 
representation of PJM to any RES that takes service hereunder.  The Company is not liable to any retail 
customer for any damages caused by any equipment installed, operated, or maintained by any entity other 
than the Company. 
 
A RES may employ a qualified agent to arrange for transmission services and ancillary transmission 
services in the RES’s name and on behalf of the RES and its retail customers, insofar as permitted under 
applicable tariffs on file with the FERC.  The RES must notify the Company in writing of the identity of the 
agent at least three (3) business days prior to the agent arranging for transmission services and ancillary 
transmission services on behalf of the RES.  The agent must not take any action that causes the RES to 
be in violation of this tariff, any other applicable tariff on file with the ICC or the FERC, or any contract 
between the Company and the RES.  The RES is responsible for each act of the agent taken in its name, 
whether or not any such act was authorized by the RES.  Employing an agent does not relieve the RES of 
any obligation under this tariff or any other applicable tariff or contract. 
 
The Company’s Schedule of Rates, of which this tariff is a part, includes General Terms and Conditions 
and other tariffs.  Service hereunder is subject to the General Terms and Conditions and other applicable 
tariffs.

TECHNICAL CHARGING STUDY 
 
 
PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this tariff is to describe the circumstances under which the Company is conducting a Multi-
Unit Dwelling (MUD) Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Technical Assessment (Study) using certain of its 
systems and to define the terms and conditions under which the Company credits to the delivery services 
revenue requirement the net revenues that the Study produces. 
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY. 
The Study is being conducted in conjunction with the United States Department of Energy (DOE).  For 
purposes of this Study, the Company will install Level 2 EV charging stations, outfitted with SAE J1772 
connectors, at no more than three MUD locations determined by the Company within one or more urban 
neighborhoods in Chicago.  The Study will conclude by the end of 2024 and includes a Phase 1 and 
Phase 2.  Phase 1 of the Study, also known as the “DOE Multi-Unit Dwelling Plug-In Electric Vehicle 
Charging Innovations Pilot” is conducted in conjunction with the DOE and concludes by 3/31/2022.  Phase 
2 is conducted solely by the Company and concludes by 12/31/2024.  Upon conclusion of Phase 2, the 
Company will undertake reasonable efforts to sell the EV charging stations to an organization that will 
continue to offer EV charging at the original station locations.   
 
The objective of Phase 1 is to develop a MUD and Curbside Residential Charging Toolkit including all 
necessary information (e.g., technical considerations, business case, sample agreements, and sample 
policies) to evaluate and implement innovative, cost-effective, and flexibly-expandable charging solutions 
that will enhance residential MUD and curbside EV charging systems to attract and retain customers.  It is 
not limited to, or designed to focus on, any particular EV owner.  The objective of Phase 2 is to gain 
additional learnings related to EV adoption and resulting grid impacts that occur as a result of EV charging 
station installations at MUDs, which learnings cannot reasonably be expected to occur within the duration 
of Phase 1. 
 
Provision of charging service under the Study is not itself a tariffed and price-regulated utility service, and 
in order to analyze the impacts of various EV charging pricing strategies on charging behavior and system 
use, pricing is subject to change throughout the duration of the Study. 
 
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. 
The Company will submit five (5) reports to the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC).  A pre-Study report 
will be submitted by 9/30/2021 and will contain the following: identity of the selected vendor, the selected 
charging locations, proposed charging scenarios, and final desired Study learnings.  The Company will 
thereafter submit periodic reports by 6/30/2022, 3/1/2023, 3/1/2024, and 3/1/2025.  These periodic reports 
will include cumulative data analysis and associated learnings relating to the use of the EV charging 
stations installed as part of this Study, including energy usage related to charging/sessions, evaluations of 
overall energy usage and use of the charging sessions over time by local residents and the general public; 
impacts of different pricing scenarios on charging behavior; revenue; cost; and grid impact.  To the extent 
available, each periodic report will also include additional data analysis on the impacts of EV adoption that 
occurs as a result of the installation of such EV charging stations.  The Company will also provide the DOE 
MUD Toolkit described in the Description of the Study section of this tariff within 30 days of such Toolkit 
becoming publicly available.   
 
MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
Implementation costs borne by the Company will be recorded as Research and Development expense.  
Revenues received by the Company for electric vehicle charging services during the course of the Study 
or by sale of EV charging stations will offset the Company’s delivery services revenue requirement.

EQUIPMENT AND EQUIPMENT DEMARCATION (CONTINUED). 
MSP Equipment (Continued) 
Defective Equipment 
The MSP must immediately notify the Company of any MSP-provided equipment that is identified 
as being inoperative or defective.  The MSP is obligated to repair or replace any such equipment 
in accordance with the EEI Handbook.  The MSP is responsible for repairing or replacing any such 
equipment within five (5) business days of such identification.  If such repair or replacement is not 
completed within five (5) business days of such identification, the Company has the right to 
remove such equipment and replace it with Company-provided equipment. 
 
If service to a retail customer is going to be or is likely to be interrupted as a result of actions taken 
by the MSP in repairing or replacing MSP-provided equipment, the MSP must notify such retail 
customer prior to taking such actions. 
 
Notwithstanding the aforementioned notification provisions of this Defective Equipment clause, if 
the MSP discovers that a safety hazard exists due to any MSP-provided equipment, the MSP is 
responsible for immediately repairing or replacing such equipment, and the MSP must not leave 
such equipment unattended until the hazardous situation is corrected.  Any such situation and the 
conditions of its resolution must be reported to the Company. 
 
Equipment Demarcation 
For a self-contained metering installation, the demarcation point between MSP-provided facilities and 
Company-provided facilities is the supply line side terminals of the meter connection device.  If the 
meter connection device has an integrated bypass provision, such bypass means is considered to be 
MSP-provided metering equipment. 
 
For a transformer-rated metering installation, the demarcation point is the meter side terminals of the 
test switches installed nearest to the supply line side of the meter.  The Company and the MSP may 
both operate the test switches, subject to applicable protocols.  However, ownership, maintenance, 
and repair of such test switches remain the responsibility of the Company.  For a transformer-rated 
metering installation using an integrated bypass provision in lieu of test switches, the bypass means is 
considered MSP-provided metering equipment. 
 
With respect to meter outputs, the demarcation point is the connection or transition device used to 
provide meter communication to an external device.  For internal or external modem communications, 
the modem is considered to be MSP-provided metering equipment.  For land-based telephone 
communications, the point of demarcation is the retail customer’s terminals of the telephone interface 
device.  For wireless communications, the entire communications unit is considered MSP-provided 
metering equipment.  For pulse output, any isolation device is considered MSP-provided metering 
equipment.  For serial communications, the demarcation point is the connector or terminal to which the 
meter output lead is attached.

requires or requests the Company to have new or different CT or PT equipment installed, the 
Company installs such equipment pursuant to the terms of Rider NS and Rider ML, or a competitive 
service contract.  The MSP is allowed to conduct its own noninvasive testing of CTs and PTs, subject 
to applicable protocols.  Collectively, CTs and PTs are defined as instrument transformers. 
 
The MSP is allowed to access the Company’s instrument transformer compartment associated with 
MSP-provided metering for the purpose of verifying transformer ratios used to determine meter usage 
data.  The MSP must notify the Company of the date and the time of such activity.  If the MSP gains 
access to the instrument transformer compartment by cutting the Company’s lock to such 
compartment without appropriate Company personnel present, the MSP must secure the compartment 
with a locking device equivalent to that provided by the Company. 
 
Except as provided in this Equipment Demarcation subsection, the MSP must not alter, modify,

SUBTRACTIVE METERING. 
A subtractive metering situation exists at a location at which a meter (Prime Meter) measures the electric 
power and energy provided to one retail customer (Prime Customer) as well as the separately metered 
electric power and energy provided to one or more other retail customers (Subtractive Customer(s)), such 
that the metered electric power and energy provided to the Subtractive Customer(s) must be subtracted 
from that measured by the Prime Meter for purposes of billing the Prime Customer.  In such cases, the 
meters that explicitly measure the electric power and energy provided to the Subtractive Customer(s) are 
considered to be Subtractive Meters.  Any Subtractive Customer eligible to elect Metering Service may 
elect to obtain such Metering Service for only those Subtractive Meters that serve such Subtractive 
Customer. 
 
Any Prime Customer eligible to elect Metering Service may elect to obtain such Metering Service for only 
those Prime Meters that serve such Prime Customer.  In a subtractive metering situation in which one or 
more MSPs provide Metering Service to one or more retail customers, each MSP must read the meter(s) 
corresponding to the retail customer(s) for which such MSP provides Metering Service.  Such MSP 
provides meter usage data for such meter(s) to the Company.  The Company then subtracts the meter 
usage data of the Subtractive Meter(s) from the gross meter usage data of the Prime Meter(s).  If the 
Prime Customer is receiving Metering Service from an MSP, the Company provides the net Prime Meter 
meter usage data to such MSP. 
 
 
BILLING, PAYMENT, AND REMITTANCE 
 
An MSP pays for services provided hereunder in accordance with the Billing and Payment part of the

coverage must be continuous and without interruption.  New Certificate(s) of Insurance must be 
filed with the Company no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date that any such renewal or 
change becomes effective.  The Certificate(s) of Insurance and the insurance policies required by 
this section must contain a provision that coverages afforded under the policies will not be 
canceled, allowed to expire, or subjected to reduction in the limits in any manner until at least thirty 
(30) days' prior written notice, ten (10) days' in the case of nonpayment of premium, has been 
given to the Company.  The Company may inspect any or all policies of insurance at any time.

financial size, the MSP must obtain new insurance coverage within thirty (30) days of such 
downgrade provided by an insurance company meeting or exceeding such minimum rating and

the rating agency reports that present the ratings of the affiliate that is the guarantor and the 
unconditional guarantee prior to commencement of service hereunder and at any time such 
unconditional guarantee is changed or renewed.

rating or long term credit rating is downgraded below the aforementioned minimum required rating, 
the MSP must obtain a new unconditional guarantee within thirty (30) days of such downgrade 
provided by a guarantor meeting or exceeding such minimum rating or obtain other acceptable 
credit assurance in accordance with this Insurance subsection.

Switch from the Company to the MSP 
For a retail customer to which a delivery class other than the High Voltage Delivery Class, Extra Large 
Load Delivery Class, or the Railroad Delivery Class is applicable or for which other circumstances 
apply because of safety, reliability, or data integrity risks, which as determined by the Company, 
require the Company to remove Company-provided meters from such retail customer’s premises, 
removal of the Company-provided meters from the retail customer’s premises is the responsibility of 
the MSP as provided herein. 
 
For a situation in which a Company-provided meter is capable of having its meter readings obtained 
remotely, the Company and the MSP reasonably cooperate to ensure that any meter reading of any 
such meter removed during a switch to the MSP occurs just prior to such removal of such meter. 
 
The MSP must submit an exchange schedule or schedules to the Company.  Each such schedule 
must be submitted to the Company by the close of business on the Thursday before the start of the 
workweek during which the meters are scheduled to be exchanged.  Each such schedule provides the 
Meter Exchange Dates and times for such workweek during which the removal of the Company-
provided meters is to occur, and it provides identification of the specific meters to be removed on each 
date.

multiple day switch provisions, as applicable, are enforced: 
 
Single Day Switch 
The Company reads all the Company-provided meters at the retail customer’s premises by noon 
on the Effective Switch Date.  In accordance with the exchange schedule provided to the

RETAIL CUSTOMER CATEGORIZATIONS 
 
SECTORS. 
The Company's retail customers are segmented into three sectors: the residential sector, the lighting 
sector, and the nonresidential sector. 
 
Residential Sector 
A retail customer is in the residential sector if electric service is provided to such retail customer at an 
individual residential occupancy premises.  For a situation in which electric service provided to a single 
premises is utilized for both residential and nonresidential purposes, including farming, such premises 
is not considered to be an individual residential occupancy premises unless the preponderant electric 
service requirement is for residential purposes. 
 
For a situation in which electric service is provided to a multiple residential occupancy building, each 
individual residential occupancy premises contained in the building is treated as a separate retail 
customer.  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this paragraph, for a multiple residential 
occupancy building containing six (6) or fewer individual residential occupancy premises, hall lighting 
and building operating equipment with no motor larger than one (1) horsepower and no more than  
six (6) horsepower for all motors may be (a) connected to the metering installation for one of the 
individual residential occupancy premises located in the building, or (b) metered separately and served 
as a separate retail customer in the residential sector. 
 
Lighting Sector 
A retail customer is in the lighting sector if electric service is provided to such retail customer for the 
purposes of operating a public street or highway general lighting system, a public street or highway 
dusk to dawn lighting system, a public street or highway intersection lighting system, a public street or 
highway decorative lighting system, a public street or highway traffic signal lighting system, a public 
waterway navigational signal lighting system, a dusk to dawn lighting system for residential private 
ways, including private parking, within a residential project, a dusk to dawn protective lighting system 
for qualifying schools, or a dusk to dawn lighting system for a public park.  Any such lighting system 
may include public safety equipment as long as such equipment uses less than 200 kWhs per monthly 
billing period.  Any such lighting system may include equipment owned or managed by a municipality 
or corporate entity used for a wireless local area network communication system available for general 
public use provided such equipment uses less than 100 kWhs per monthly billing period at each 
location that such equipment is installed and the majority of such equipment installations are attached 
to street lighting and traffic signal equipment.  A single lighting retail customer may have electric 
service provided to multiple physical locations provided all such locations are located within a single 
municipality. 
 
A portion of the electric service provided to a retail customer located outside the City of Chicago to 
which either the residential sector or the nonresidential sector is applicable is considered to be in the 
lighting sector if such portion is for the provision of outdoor, fixture-included, dusk to dawn lighting for 
such retail customer's private use.

Competitively Declared Customer Group 
Competitively Declared Customer Group means the customer group applicable to any retail customer for which 
electric service has been declared competitive.  The Competitively Declared Customer Group applies to a retail 
customer determined to have electric power and energy requirements of at least 100 kW, as determined by the 
Company.  A retail customer is determined to have electric power and energy requirements of at least 100 kW 
if (a) for any such retail customer that had been taking service from the Company during the preceding January 
through December monthly billing periods, such retail customer established a thirty (30) minute demand for 
electricity of at least 100 kW in at least two (2) monthly billing periods during such preceding monthly billing 
periods; or (b) in the Company’s reasonable judgment there exists comparable usage information or a sufficient 
basis to determine that such retail customer has electric power and energy requirements of at least 100 kW; or 
(c) (i) such retail customer had previously been determined to have electric power and energy requirements of 
at least 100 kW pursuant to either of the aforementioned items (a) or (b), and (ii) such retail customer 
established a thirty (30) minute demand for electricity of at least 100 kW at least one (1) time during such 
preceding monthly billing periods.  For a retail customer for which the Company has been providing electric 
service, the Company determines the electric power and energy requirements of such retail customer on or 
before March 15 each year.  For an applicant or a successor retail customer at a premises, such determination 
is made prior to the date that electric service begins to be provided to such applicant or successor retail 
customer.  In accordance with Section 16-103.1 of the Act, in determining if a retail customer has electric power 
and energy requirements of at least 100 kW, the Company does not consider a retail customer that is a unit 
owners’ association, as defined in Section 2 of the Condominium Property Act.  In addition, in determining if a 
retail customer has electric power and energy requirements of at least 100 kW, the Company does not consider 
a retail customer for which the residential customer group is applicable. 
 
For a retail customer (a) that has been taking bundled electric service from the Company continuously under a 
tariff that does not have provisions for hourly pricing since prior to the date on or before March 15 that such 
retail customer is determined to have electric power and energy requirements of at least 100 kW; and (b) that 
continues to take service under such tariff through the May monthly billing period following such date, the 
Competitively Declared Customer Group applies to such retail customer immediately following such May 
monthly billing period.  Otherwise, the Competitively Declared Customer Group applies to such retail customer 
immediately after such retail customer is determined to have electric power and energy requirements of at least 
100 kW.

GENERAL ACCOUNT AGENT. 
A General Account Agent (GAA) is an individual or entity (a) designated by a retail customer to act on 
behalf of such retail customer in arranging and managing tariffed services provided by the Company in 
regard to one or more designated retail customer account(s), and (b) acting in accordance with this 
General Account Agent section.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an individual that is acting without 
compensation as an agent for a residential retail customer and that is not providing electric power and 
energy supply service or other electric service to such residential retail customer is not required to be a 
GAA. 
 
Moreover, a RES taking service under Rate RESS – Retail Electric Supplier Service (Rate RESS), is not 
required to be a GAA in order to provide electric power and energy supply service to a retail customer 
taking service under Rate RDS, or to act as an agent with respect to transmission services and ancillary 
transmission services provided under applicable tariffs on file with the FERC.  However, the retail 
customer must designate the RES as a GAA if the RES arranges or manages other tariffed services 
provided by the Company in regard to one or more designated retail customer account(s).  Other than as 
provided in this paragraph, the Company is not required to recognize any agent appointed by a retail 
customer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, for a situation in which an agent had been designated 
prior to May 1, 2002, by a retail customer to act on behalf of such retail customer in arranging and 
managing tariffed services provided by the Company in regard to one or more designated retail customer 
account(s), and the Company was advised of such designation prior to such date and has not been 
advised that such agency relationship has been terminated, such agent is not required to be a GAA in 
order to continue to serve as the agent of such retail customer in relation to such designated retail

Designation of a GAA 
The Company accepts a retail customer’s designation of a GAA only if the retail customer submits to 
the Company a completed and executed Designation of General Account Agent (Designation) in the 
form available from the Company, and not as part of any other document.  The Designation form may 
not be amended, modified, or altered, and the Company is not required to accept a Designation that is 
amended, modified, or altered.  A GAA is an agent of the retail customer, not of the Company. 
 
A valid Designation remains effective unless and until the retail customer provides the Company a 
written termination, the retail customer submits a new valid Designation, the GAA submits to the 
Company a written resignation, or the Designation is terminated by operation of law.  The Designation 
also terminates if the retail customer takes service under tariffs or other programs that consolidate or 
combine services in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this General Account Agent section. 
 
Nature and Authority of a GAA 
A GAA has authority to act on behalf of the retail customer in arranging and managing tariffed services 
provided by the Company with respect to the retail customer account(s) identified in the Designation, 
except that a GAA does not have authority to request that the Company release the retail customer's 
prior credit history or to request that the Company terminate electric service to the retail customer.  
The Company treats all representations and requests made by a GAA as being made by the retail 
customer, and relies and acts on such representations and requests without further authorization of 
the retail customer.  The Company is not liable or responsible for any action or omission taken by the 
Company in reliance upon any representation or request made by a GAA.  The retail customer must 
indemnify and hold the Company harmless against any claim arising out of any action or omission that 
the Company takes in reliance upon any representation or request made by a GAA.  The Company is 
not liable or responsible for any failure of a GAA to adequately represent the retail customer’s 
interests.

GENERAL ACCOUNT AGENT (CONTINUED). 
Nature and Authority of a GAA (Continued) 
The Company is not a party to any agreement(s) between the retail customer and the GAA and is not 
bound by any term, condition, or provision of such agreement(s).  A retail customer’s designation of a 
GAA does not amend, modify, or alter the Company’s tariffs or any contracts between the Company 
and the retail customer.  A GAA has no authority to enter into any agreement on behalf of the 
Company or to amend, modify, or alter any of the Company’s tariffs, contracts, or procedures, or to 
bind the Company by making any promises, representations, or omissions.  The designation of a GAA 
does not affect the retail customer’s responsibilities to timely pay the Company all amounts due and 
perform and satisfy all other obligations applicable to the retail customer.  The retail customer remains 
responsible to timely pay the Company for all balances due for services provided by the Company and 
all other balances owed the Company, even if the GAA fails to remit to the Company amounts paid by 
the retail customer to the GAA for remittance to the Company.  The designation of a GAA does not 
give the retail customer or the GAA any additional rights beyond those the retail customer otherwise 
has under the Company’s tariffs and any agreements between the Company and the retail customer.  
The Company is not required to perform services for a GAA, as agent of the retail customer, that the 
Company does not perform for the retail customer. 
 
Provisions Related to Service Under Special or Consolidated Tariffs 
A retail customer that (a) has designated a GAA, and (b) is taking service under tariffs or other 
programs that consolidate or combine services provided to more than one retail customer or account 
and that involve a consolidated bill or a single point of contact, must designate the same GAA for all 
retail customers or accounts that are billed through the same consolidated bill or that have the same 
single point of contact. 
 
Communication 
The Company may communicate with the GAA on all matters about which the Company is otherwise 
required to communicate with the retail customer under the Company’s tariffs and any agreements 
between the Company and the retail customer.  The provisions of the previous sentence do not affect 
the Company’s right to communicate directly with the retail customer on matters including, but not 
limited to, notices, safety, electric energy contingency, system reliability, planned outages, 
curtailments, interruptions, tree trimming, switch confirmation, power purchase option termination or 
renewal notices, credit, disconnection, and resumption of service. 
 
RESALE OR REDISTRIBUTION. 
The resale or redistribution of electric power and energy is prohibited.  It is necessary that each retail 
customer located in the Company's service territory is provided with separate meter-related facilities and 
designated as a separate retail customer.

NATURE OF SERVICE 
 
The Company provides electric service to retail customers.  There are three types of electric service that 
the Company provides.  These three types are described in this Nature of Service part and include 
(a) bundled electric service, (b) delivery service, and (c) delivery service with unbundled electric supply. 
 
The Company is not responsible for damages for any failure to provide electric service, or for interruption 
to one or more phases, or reversal of such service, if such failure, interruption, or reversal is without willful 
default or negligence on the Company's part. Nor is the Company responsible for interruptions, by under

Company's service territory or the regional interconnected electric systems. 
 
BUNDLED ELECTRIC SERVICE. 
*  Bundled electric service is the provision to retail customers of electric power and energy by the Company 
in accordance with the terms of this Bundled Electric Service section.  Such provision includes (1) 
procurement of all the component services the Company requires to meet retail customer instantaneous 
electric power and energy requirements at any given time under the Company’s tariffs, applicable tariffs on 
file with the FERC, and other applicable law, including, without limitation, all required electric energy, 
energy to satisfy losses, electric generation capacity, volumetric risk management, transmission services, 
ancillary transmission services, administrative services, and other necessary services procured by the 
Company, (2) delivery of the electric power and energy via the Company’s distribution facilities, including 
the provision of reactive power and voltage support using distribution facilities, at the rates and subject to 
the terms, conditions, and limitations provided in the Company’s tariffs on file with the ICC, and (3) the 
Company’s standard metering and billing that are necessary to permit eligible retail customers to receive 
service as permitted by law and by tariffs approved by the ICC and the FERC.  For a situation in which a 
retail customer is provided with electric service under a tariff for bundled electric service, no component of 
such bundled electric service may be provided to such retail customer by a third party, and components of 
bundled electric service are not available separately from the Company under such tariff.  Bundled electric 
service is provided under Rate BES and Rate BESH - Basic Electric Service Hourly Pricing (Rate BESH).  
Specific applicability and limitation provisions are provided in each such tariff.

Delivery Service 
Delivery service is the delivery of electric power and energy to retail customers by the Company in 
accordance with the terms of this Delivery Service subsection.  Such delivery includes (1) the delivery 
of electric power and energy on the Company’s distribution facilities, including the provision of reactive 
power and voltage support using distribution facilities, at the rates and subject to the terms, conditions, 
and limitations provided for in its tariffs on file with the ICC; (2) the delivery of electric power and 
energy on the transmission facilities located in the Company’s service territory, at the same rates and 
subject to the same terms, conditions, and limitations specified in applicable tariffs on file with the 
FERC governing transactions over the transmission facilities located in the Company’s service 
territory; (3) those other transmission, ancillary transmission, and/or related services that the FERC 
determines should be offered by the Company or other providers of transmission services on 
transmission facilities located in the Company’s service territory, under applicable tariffs on file with the 
FERC governing the provision of such services, at the same rates and subject to the same terms, 
conditions, and limitations specified in such tariffs; and (4) the Company’s standard metering and 
billing services that are necessary to permit eligible retail customers to receive service under Rate 
RDS as permitted by law and by tariffs approved by the ICC and by the FERC.  All the foregoing 
constitute delivery service.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, transmission, ancillary transmission, and/or 
related services may be provided by a provider, other than the Company, on transmission facilities 
located in the Company’s service territory, in connection with a transaction under Rate RDS if: 
(a) applicable tariffs on file with the FERC governing the provision of such services on the 
transmission facilities located in the Company’s service territory allow for or require the provision of 
such services by such other provider, and (b) those services are provided at the same rates, terms, 
and conditions as are provided in such tariffs. 
 
In accordance with federal law and FERC determinations, the Company’s obligation to provide or 
arrange for the provision of certain components of delivery service, which includes the procurement 
and arrangement for the procurement of federal-jurisdictional services for itself and its retail 
customers, is met through its membership in PJM.  The delivery service components so provided are 
taken at the same rates and subject to the same terms, conditions, and limitations as are authorized 
by the FERC and the Company is not liable for the performance, representations, actions, or 
omissions of PJM. 
 
In the event that the Company no longer owns transmission facilities or no longer is obligated by the 
FERC to provide transmission services or ancillary transmission services, then the Company's 
obligation to provide or arrange for the provision of such delivery service components terminates.

UNBUNDLED ELECTRIC SERVICE (CONTINUED). 
Unbundled Supply Service 
  Unbundled electric supply service is the provision to retail customers of electric power and energy 
supply by the Company under Rider PPO - Power Purchase Option (Rider PPO).  Such provision 
includes the procurement of all the component services the Company requires to meet retail customer 
instantaneous electric power and energy requirements at any given time under the Company’s tariffs, 
applicable tariffs on file with the FERC, and other applicable law, including, without limitation, all 
required electric energy, energy to satisfy losses, electric generation capacity, volumetric risk 
management, transmission services, ancillary transmission services, administrative services, and other 
necessary services procured by the Company in order to provide electric power and energy to retail 
customers served under Rider PPO.  Specific applicability and limitation provisions are provided in 
Rider PPO. 
 
ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS. 
The Company provides alternating current (AC) electric service with a nominal frequency of sixty (60) 
hertz (cycles per second). 
 
However, in certain individual situations, certain retail customers in the central part of the City of Chicago 
are provided with direct current (DC) electric service.  Such retail customers are provided with electric 
service through rectifiers that convert AC to DC.  Such retail customers have been provided with DC 
electric service since the early years of the twentieth century.  Beginning in the 1930's, the Company has 
been working toward the retirement of DC electric service.  The Company does not serve new or 
increased electric power and energy requirements of any retail customer with DC electric service.  For a 
situation in which DC electric service is retired at a retail customer's premises, the Company removes its 
rectifier and associated AC to DC conversion equipment that had been used to provide electric service to 
such premises.  Eventually, all such rectifiers and associated AC to DC conversion equipment will be so 
removed, and all retail customers will be provided with AC electric service.

SERVICE APPLICATION, COMMENCEMENT, AND CONTINUATION (CONTINUED) 
 
PERMITS, INSPECTIONS, AND APPROVALS. 
Inspection of the retail customer’s or applicant's electrical facilities for compliance with electric, safety, and 
local codes is in the province of governmental authorities.  The retail customer or applicant is responsible 
for obtaining all permits, inspections, and approvals required by governmental authorities.  For premises at 
which governmental approval is required prior to commencement of electric service, the Company does 
not provide electric service until the retail customer or applicant obtains such approval.  Any costs or fees 
incurred in obtaining permits, inspections, or approvals are the retail customer’s or applicant's 
responsibility, and the retail customer or applicant must secure, without cost to the Company, all 
necessary governmental permits for the installation and operation of electrical facilities at the premises. 
 
It is the retail customer's or applicant's responsibility to ensure that its electrical facilities meet all 
applicable state and local regulations, as well as the standards of the National Fire Protection Association 
contained in the National Electrical Code.  For a situation in which a code or regulation applicable to the 
retail customer's or applicant's facilities is or becomes more stringent than requirements described in these 
General Terms and Conditions, the more stringent rules apply. 
 
All electrical facilities, wiring, and associated equipment furnished by the retail customer or applicant at the 
premises, or connecting to the Company's electric distribution facilities, must be suitable for such 
purposes, and must be furnished, installed, operated, and maintained by the retail customer or applicant at 
all times in compliance with the requirements of the National Fire Protection Association, applicable 
governmental authorities and local codes, applicable electric and safety codes, these General Terms and 
Conditions, and any other applicable Company specifications.  However, examination of such facilities, 
wiring and equipment by the Company is not evidence of compliance with any applicable codes, and the 
Company assumes no obligation to inspect such facilities, wiring, and equipment to ensure such 
compliance. 
 
For a situation in which the retail customer or applicant is not the owner of the premises or of any 
intervening property between such premises and the Company's distribution system facilities, the retail 
customer or applicant is responsible for obtaining and maintaining from the intervening property owner(s) 
necessary consent for the installation, operation and maintenance on such premises and on such 
intervening property of all electrical facilities, wiring, and associated equipment required for the provision of 
electric service to the retail customer or applicant.  For a situation in which the Company must cross 
adjacent property with electric service conductors in order to provide electric service to the retail customer 
or applicant, such retail customer or applicant is responsible for securing and maintaining the consent of 
the owner(s) of the adjacent property.  If consent of the intervening property owner is lost and, as a result, 
relocation of Company facilities becomes necessary, such relocation is provided to the retail customer or 
applicant in accordance with the provisions for providing nonstandard services and facilities.

CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS. 
In certain situations and in accordance with the provisions of certain tariffs included in the Company’s 
Schedule of Rates, the retail customer or applicant is required to enter into an agreement or contract with 
the Company in order to obtain, modify, or maintain the provision of electric service at the premises. 
 
The benefits and obligations of a contract for service are inuring and binding upon the successors and 
assigns of the original parties thereto, respectively, for the full term thereof, provided that no assignment is 
made by such retail customer, applicant, RES, or MSP, as applicable, without first obtaining the 
Company's written consent, and provided further that the successor executes and delivers to the 
Company an agreement assuming to be bound by the original contract. 
 
TARIFF SELECTION. 
For a situation in which there is or becomes a choice of tariffs under which electric service can be provided 
by the Company, the retail customer or applicant is responsible for tariff selection.  The Company does not 
guarantee that the tariff or combination of tariffs selected by the retail customer or applicant is or will 
remain more or less advantageous than any other possible tariff combination, nor is the Company 
responsible for notifying the retail customer or applicant of the most advantageous tariff or combination of 
tariffs.  For a situation in which a retail customer or applicant is or becomes eligible for electric service 
under more than one tariff, no refunds are made for differences in the charges under such different tariffs. 
 
For a situation in which a retail customer or applicant does not select service under a tariff that is available 
to such retail customer or such election is not made in accordance with the provisions of such tariff, the 
retail customer or applicant is assigned to a tariff that is otherwise applicable to such retail customer or 
applicant. 
 
For a situation in which a retail customer’s or applicant’s electric power and energy requirements or 
characteristics change in a manner that different tariffs become available to such retail customer or 
applicant and such retail customer or applicant does not select service under such different tariff(s) in 
accordance with the provisions of such tariff(s), the retail customer or applicant is assigned to a tariff that 
is otherwise applicable to such retail customer or applicant. 
 
For a situation in which a retail customer elects to switch from one tariff to another, commencement of 
service under the newly elected tariff begins only after such retail customer fulfills its obligations with 
respect to the tariff under which it has heretofore been served. 
 
  The Company reserves the right to change the tariff or combination of tariffs under which it provides 
electric service to a retail customer for a situation in which the Company determines that such retail 
customer is taking service under a tariff or combination of tariffs for which such retail customer is not 
eligible.

through the above process, later have been designated as eligible by the Company, the Company shall 
return the deposit within the next two monthly billing periods after the date of designation.  The Company

entity responsible for the building located at such premises except as provided in the Installation of 
Facilities section of the Billing and Payment part of these General Terms and Conditions, and (e) the 
costs associated with such repairs are included in the costs of providing metering service-related 
delivery service to retail customers generally. 
 
At any time during the meter replacement process, for a situation in which a condition that does not 
comply with applicable Company and/or safety standards is identified and for which a remedy requires 
additional or other repairs, additions, or modifications to the facilities of the retail customer or the entity 
responsible for the building located at such premises, as applicable, the Company suspends the meter 
replacement activities and notifies such retail customer or entity to make all repairs, additions, or 
modifications to such facilities necessary to remedy the condition at such retail customer’s or entity’s 
sole expense and responsibility.  Meter replacement activities resume after such condition is 
remedied, as appropriate.  The Company never makes major repairs to facilities not owned by the 
Company. 
 
At any time during the meter replacement process, for a situation in which the non AMI meter and/or 
its meter fitting is determined to be in an immediately or imminently unsafe condition, electric service 
delivered at such metering installation is immediately disconnected until changes are made so that 
such metering installation is safe. 
 
The Company is not responsible for damages resulting from any repair, or from any failure to perform 
a repair, absent willful default or negligence on the Company’s part. 
 
Company owned facilities remain the property of the Company even in the event they are repaired by 
an entity other than the Company.

RETAIL CUSTOMER'S UTILIZATION EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED). 
For a situation in which a retail customer's electrical equipment has characteristics that produce low power 
factor, the Company has the right to require the retail customer to correct its low power factor to a value 
not less than eighty-five per cent (85%) lagging at the time the retail customer establishes its thirty (30) 
minute maximum demand, as measured at the metering installation provided for the retail customer.  In 
such situation, either (a) the retail customer must furnish, install, and maintain the necessary equipment to 
correct its power factor in accordance with Company specifications, or (b) the Company, at its sole 
discretion, furnishes the necessary facilities in accordance with the provisions for providing nonstandard 
services and facilities.

transformers for power factor improvement, the retail customer must furnish a means of automatically 
disconnecting any or all capacitors when the equipment causing the low power factor is not operating.  
However, in the event that it is not practical for the retail customer to comply with the provisions of the 
previous sentence, the Company furnishes any necessary additional transformer capacity and capacitors 
with such automatic disconnecting means in accordance with the provisions for providing nonstandard 
services and facilities.  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this paragraph, for a situation in which 
the retail customer owns the primary service connection, such retail customer is allowed to install any 
necessary capacitors and automatic disconnecting means on such primary service connection.  In such 
case, the Company furnishes any necessary additional transformer capacity in accordance with the 
provisions for providing nonstandard services and facilities. 
 
For a situation in which a retail customer has high frequency equipment, including but not limited to, 
electronic heating equipment, spark discharge devices, and radio transmitting equipment, such equipment 
must be designed and operated so as not to create higher frequencies on, or other disturbances to, the 
Company's sixty (60) hertz distribution system which might interfere with the proper operation of 
communication or remote control systems, computers, electronic production equipment, radios, or other 
equipment of other retail customers or the Company. 
 
The Company must be consulted regarding electric service requirements for arc furnaces.  Transformer 
type welders cannot be operated from a service voltage less than 208 volts. 
 
The Company reserves the right to examine and test the retail customer's electrical equipment that is 
connected to the Company's distribution facilities and to require that such equipment are provided with 
nameplates showing the voltage, phase, full load amperes, maximum current, maximum kilovolt-amperes, 
and such other information as may be necessary to determine the operating characteristics of such

GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
*    (Continued from Sheet No. 154.1) 
 
DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES (CONTINUED) 
 
All distribution facilities provided by the Company for the purpose of providing electric service to a retail 
customer, unless otherwise expressly provided, are the property of the Company, and such retail customer 
must exercise reasonable care to protect such property from loss or damage. 
 
For a situation in which the Company's property is damaged, the entity responsible for such damage is 
assessed for the fully allocated cost to repair or replace such property. 
 
  For a situation in which electrical facilities or associated equipment at a premises furnished by the retail 
customer or the entity responsible for the building located at such premises, as applicable, for connection 
to the Company's electric distribution facilities become unsuitable for such purposes, or are not installed, 
operated, or maintained by such retail customer or entity, as applicable, in accordance with applicable 
requirements or specifications, resulting in damage to Company facilities or unsafe conditions, such retail 
customer or entity, as applicable, must make changes to its facilities or equipment or provide and maintain 
any necessary additional equipment to prevent or eliminate such damage or unsafe conditions.  If the retail 
customer or entity, as applicable, does not make such changes or provide such additional equipment, the 
Company, at its sole discretion if it is practical to do so, furnishes, installs, owns, operates, replaces, and 
maintains suitable facilities to eliminate such damage or unsafe conditions in accordance with the 
provisions for providing nonstandard services and facilities.  Otherwise, the Company may disconnect 
electric service to the retail customer until such retail customer or entity, as applicable, completes actions 
necessary to eliminate such damage or unsafe conditions. 
 
  Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous paragraph, if such situation is related to the deployment of 
AMI meters as described in the AMI Deployment subsection of the Access to Premises section of the 
Service Application, Commencement, and Continuation part of these General Terms and Conditions, then 
the Company acts in accordance with the provisions of such AMI Deployment subsection. 
 
A standard distribution facilities installation provided by the Company for a retail customer includes 
distribution facilities adequate to provide, at a single delivery point, the electric power and energy required 
by such retail customer.  However, in certain individual situations, more than one delivery point is provided 
in a standard distribution facilities installation if the Company determines that the provision of such multiple 
delivery points is more economical, efficient, or reliable than an installation with a single delivery point.  In 
certain other individual situations involving buildings with multiple occupants, only one delivery point is 
provided in a standard distribution facilities installation if the Company determines that the provision of 
such single delivery point is more economical, efficient, or reliable than an installation with a delivery point 
for each occupant.  The electric power and energy requirements of a retail customer equal the highest 
MKD established by such retail customer during the twelve (12) preceding monthly billing periods at a 
power factor of not less than eighty-five percent (85%) lagging.  For a retail customer for which historical 
electric usage data is not available, the electric power and energy requirements of such retail customer 
equal the highest MKD the Company expects to be established by such retail customer at a power factor 
of not less than 85% lagging, based upon the Company's determination made in accordance with 
information provided by such retail customer. 
 
If other or additional distribution facilities are furnished by the Company for the Company's convenience, 
such facilities are deemed to be part of a standard distribution facilities installation.

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES (CONTINUED) 
 
PRIMARY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. 
The Company’s primary distribution system utilizes electric facilities to distribute electricity at the following 
common nominal voltages:  4,000 volts, 12,000 volts, and/or 34,500 volts.  However, in certain individual 
situations, the Company’s primary distribution system utilizes electric facilities to distribute electricity at 
69,000 volts, 138,000 volts, or 345,000 volts, if the Company determines that distribution at such nominal 
voltage is more economical, efficient, or reliable than distribution at a voltage listed in the first sentence of 
this paragraph.  Not all primary distribution system nominal voltages are available in all areas of the 
Company's service territory. 
 
The Company provides primary overhead conductors supported by poles and other associated equipment 
as standard primary distribution system facilities.  However, in certain individual situations, the Company 
provides primary underground conductors in conduit or via direct burial and other associated equipment if 
the Company determines that such underground facilities are more economical, efficient, or reliable than 
overhead facilities.  If a retail customer requests the provision of underground primary distribution facilities, 
such facilities are provided in accordance with the provisions for providing nonstandard services and 
facilities.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous sentence, the Company is not required to provide 
underground primary distribution system facilities if the Company determines that it is not economical, 
reliable, or feasible to provide such facilities. 
 
PRIMARY SERVICE CONNECTIONS. 
The Company determines the point on its primary distribution system at which a primary service 
connection is attached. 
 
Overhead Connections 
An overhead primary service connection consists of those facilities, including conductors and required 
supports, that attach the Company's primary distribution system to the facilities used to transform 
electricity to the secondary service voltage.  However, in certain individual situations, there is no 
transformation. 
 
For a nonresidential retail customer, as applicable, up to two (2) poles and three (3) conductor spans, 
or their cost equivalent, are furnished, installed, owned, replaced and maintained by the Company as 
a standard primary service connection.  The length of such conductor spans must not exceed lengths 
permitted by good engineering practice and Company specifications applicable to the voltage level of 
such connection. 
 
For a residential retail customer, the Company furnishes, installs, owns, replaces and maintains a 
single conductor span and required supports extending from the Company's overhead primary 
distribution system to the first point of attachment on private property as a standard primary service 
connection.  Such point is normally located on such residential retail customer's premises.  The length 
of the conductor span making such connection must not exceed the length permitted by good 
engineering practice and Company specifications applicable to the voltage level of such connection.  
The maximum length of a standard primary service connection is 150 feet.

connection span at a residential retail customer's premises, such residential retail customer must 
furnish, install, own and maintain the remainder of the overhead primary service connection including 
the first support on private property. 
 
It is the retail customer’s responsibility to obtain information from the Company with respect to 
clearance requirements for primary service connections. 
 
*  Underground Connections 
An underground primary service connection consists of those facilities, including the underground 
conductors or cables, terminals, ducts, and other related distribution facilities that attach the 
Company's primary distribution system to the facilities used to transform electricity to the secondary 
service voltage.  However, in certain individual situations, there is no transformation. 
 
For a nonresidential retail customer located in an area with an existing underground distribution 
system, the Company furnishes, installs, owns, replaces, and maintains an underground primary 
service connection from the Company's underground distribution system to the boundary of the 
premises in the provision of a standard primary service connection.  The nonresidential retail customer 
furnishes, installs, owns, and maintains duct in accordance with Company specifications from a point 
at the boundary of the premises designated by the Company to the facilities used to transform 
electricity to the secondary service voltage serving the nonresidential retail customer.  However, in 
certain individual situations, there is no transformation.  Such connection is extended onto the 
nonresidential retail customer's premises to the building wall closest to the Company’s distribution 
system, including the cable in customer provided duct in the provision of a standard primary service 
connection, provided the length of such primary service connection does not exceed 700 feet.  Such 
700 feet is measured from the point at which the cable crosses the lot line, or if the Company’s 
existing underground distribution system used to supply the nonresidential customer is located on a 
utility easement, such 700 feet is measured from the point at which the cable exists the utility 
easement.  If additional facilities are required for such primary service connection, the Company 
initially provides such facilities in accordance with the provisions for providing nonstandard services 
and facilities.  Subsequent to such initial provision in duct furnished, installed, owned, and maintained 
by the customer, the Company owns, operates, maintains, and replaces such facilities in accordance 
with the provisions for providing standard services and facilities.

*  TRANSFORMATION. 
For a retail customer to which the Railroad Delivery Class is applicable, the voltage of the electricity 
distributed through the Company's primary distribution system is not transformed by the Company to a 
nominal secondary voltage before being used by the retail customer.  For a nonresidential retail customer, 
except a nonresidential retail customer to which the Watt-Hour Delivery Class is applicable, the voltage of 
the electricity distributed through the Company's primary distribution system may be used by such retail 
customer at one or more locations at such retail customer’s premises (a) without being transformed by the 
Company, (b) after being transformed by the Company to 2,400 volts or above, or (c) after being 
transformed by the Company to a nominal secondary service voltage.  For a residential retail customer, a 
nonresidential retail customer to which the Watt-Hour Delivery Class is applicable, or a lighting retail 
customer, the voltage of the electricity distributed through the Company's primary distribution system is 
generally transformed by the Company to a nominal secondary service voltage before being used by the 
retail customer. 
 
Generally, a single such transformation is provided by the Company in the provision of a standard 
transformation installation.  However, in certain individual situations, more than one transformation is 
provided in a standard transformation installation if the Company determines that the provision of such 
multiple transformations is more economical, efficient, or reliable than an installation with a single 
transformation.  In certain other individual situations involving buildings with multiple occupants, only one 
transformation is provided in a standard transformation installation if the Company determines that the 
provision of such single transformation is more economical, efficient, or reliable than a separate 
transformation installation for each occupant.  If a retail customer requests or requires the provision of 
other or additional transformation, such transformation facilities are provided by the Company in 
accordance with the provisions for providing nonstandard services and facilities. 
 
Community Facilities 
Standard transformation from a nominal primary distribution system voltage to a nominal secondary 
service voltage for more than one retail customer is provided by a community transformer installation.  
Community transformer installations are provided in areas with an overhead distribution system and in 
areas with an underground distribution system.  Community transformer installations include 
installations on public property, rights-of-way, or easements acquired by the Company to serve more 
than one retail customer at the nominal secondary service voltage provided for the area. 
 
For a situation in which a multiple occupancy building is provided with a 480 volt, three-phase nominal 
secondary service voltage, the retail customers that are occupants of such building may be provided 
with a lower nominal secondary service voltage through additional transformers provided for the entire 
building, located in such building.  If the Company is requested to provide such additional transformers 
and related facilities, all such transformers and facilities are provided in accordance with the provisions 
for providing nonstandard services and facilities.  In such case, the Company delivers such 
transformers and related facilities to the building, but installation and maintenance of such facilities is 
the responsibility of the entity responsible for the building.

Electric Service Station 
For a situation in which the nominal secondary or transformed service voltage for a nonresidential 
retail customer is different from that available from existing community facilities or if the electric power 
and energy requirements of such nonresidential retail customer preclude the use of such community 
facilities, transformation is provided via an electric service station located on the nonresidential retail 
customer's premises.  An electric service station includes the land, enclosures, foundations, 
structures, poles, vaults, transformer, and related facilities necessary to make such transformation.  
The Company furnishes, installs, operates, replaces and maintains a pole-mounted, ground-type, or 
vault-type transformer and related electrical equipment, as applicable and consistent with good 
engineering practice, for such nonresidential retail customer.  The nonresidential retail customer must 
furnish, install, own, operate, replace, and maintain (a) an acceptable location on its premises for the 
electric service station, and as required, (b) the concrete foundations, fences, structures, fireproof 
enclosures, ventilation, lighting, barriers, locks, drainage facilities, sump pumps, and any other 
required facilities in accordance with applicable electric, safety, and local codes and Company 
specifications.  In certain individual situations, a standard electric service station includes modification 
of the transformer terminals necessary to connect the nonresidential retail customer's cables, bus for a 
situation in which the Company deems it necessary, cable connectors, and the attachment of the 
connectors to the nonresidential retail customer's cables and the transformer or bus.  In certain other 
situations, a standard electric service station includes facilities to accommodate primary meter-related 
facilities provided by the Company at the same location or within one span of such location.  In certain 
other situations, electricity is distributed and metered at the nonresidential retail customer's premises 
at 2,160 volts or higher and the primary meter-related facilities constitute the electric service station. 
 
All electric facilities located on the nonresidential retail customer's premises on such nonresidential 
retail customer's side of an electric service station, except Company-provided meter-related facilities, 
are furnished, installed, owned, operated, and maintained by the nonresidential retail customer.  
However, in certain individual situations, additional electric service stations are located on the 
nonresidential retail customer's side of an electric service station and the Company-provided facilities 
in such electric service stations are provided in accordance with the provisions for providing 
nonstandard services and facilities. 
 
For a situation in which the nominal secondary service voltage from a vault-type electric service station 
does not exceed 480 volts, the nonresidential retail customer may elect to install bus bars.  If the 
nonresidential retail customer makes such election, an insulated bus configuration furnished by the 
nonresidential retail customer must terminate either (a) twelve (12) inches inside the vault wall, or 
(b) within twelve (12) inches outside the vault wall, in accordance with Company specifications.  In 
such situation, the Company installs, owns, operates, replaces, and maintains the facilities, including 
bus bars, necessary to connect the nonresidential retail customer's bus bars to the Company's 
transformer in accordance with the provisions for providing nonstandard services and facilities.

For a situation in which the Company’s pole to which the secondary service connection is attached is 
so close to the retail customer's building that it is impractical to install a secondary service connection 
in the usual manner, the retail customer must install a service head adjacent to the pole at a point on 
the building designated by the Company, and the Company makes the connection.  No service 
attachment is required in this situation. 
 
For a situation in which the retail customer undertakes any action to install or modify any equipment or 
structure such that clearances for Company distribution facilities are reduced to the point of 
noncompliance with any applicable code, such retail customer is responsible for notifying the 
Company prior to undertaking such action.  If as a result of such action, the Company is required to 
modify or relocate its distribution facilities, such modification or relocation is provided in accordance 
with the provisions for providing nonstandard services and facilities. 
 
In certain individual situations in which the retail customer provides a recessed service head, the 
Company furnishes and attaches lugs to the secondary service connection conductors and the retail 
customer attaches the lugs to the bus inside the retail customer's building. 
 
Under previously applicable rules of service, certain residential retail customers have been provided 
with secondary service connections owned by the Company that include Company poles on private 
property.  The Company continues to own and maintain such secondary service connections required 
to provide electric service to these certain residential retail customers.  Notwithstanding the previous 
provisions of this paragraph, for a situation in which any such residential retail customer so requests, 
the Company transfers the portion of such secondary service connection in excess of that constituting 
a standard secondary service connection to the residential retail customer in good and serviceable 
condition.  If the residential retail customer requests the secondary service connection to be relocated, 
the Company performs such relocation in accordance with the provisions for providing nonstandard 
services and facilities.  If the residential retail customer requests or requires an increase in the capacity 
of the secondary service connection, including but not limited to providing an additional phase or 
phases, the Company makes the necessary changes to the secondary service connection facilities in 
accordance with the provisions for providing nonstandard services and facilities for all facilities 
provided in excess of a standard secondary service connection to serve such residential retail 
customer's electric power and energy requirements.

assessed the fully allocated cost to repair or replace such property. 
 
  For a situation in which a retail customer anticipates the need for an alteration to or a change in the  
meter-related facilities provided by the Company for such retail customer, it is the retail customer's 
responsibility to notify the Company as far in advance of the need for the change as possible so that 
arrangements can be made to facilitate any necessary changes to the Company's meter-related facilities.  
Any relocation, removal, or alteration of meter-related facilities provided by the Company, as required or 
requested by the retail customer, is provided in accordance with the provisions for providing nonstandard 
services and facilities or non AMI metering, as applicable.  For a situation in which there is a change in the 
retail customer’s operation, construction, or property, which in the judgment of the Company makes the 
relocation of the Company's meter-related facilities necessary, the Company relocates such facilities in 
accordance with the provisions for providing nonstandard services and facilities or non AMI metering, as 
applicable. 
 
The retail customer is responsible for ensuring that any portion of the metering installation furnished by 
such retail customer is in compliance with all applicable electric, safety, and local codes and Company 
specifications.  The Company has the right to refuse to make the connection to provide electric service to 
the retail customer for a situation in which the portion of the metering installation furnished by such retail 
customer is not in compliance with any such code or Company specification. 
 
  Tampering with the Company's meter-related facilities, breaking meter seals, and/or installing conductors 
to carry unmetered current are prohibited by law.  Meters must not be disconnected, removed or relocated 
without Company authorization.  Tampering with any meter, the associated wiring or related facilities to 
reduce a retail customer's metered usage may result in disconnection of service and/or require a service 
deposit.  In addition, for a situation in which tampering occurs, the involved retail customer is charged for 
the Company's estimated revenue loss attributable to such tampering plus all related expenses incurred 
by the Company in replacing, restoring, and/or repairing its facilities.

BILLING AND PAYMENT 
 
For purposes of brevity, retail customer, as used in this Billing and Payment part, refers to a retail 
customer or applicant, as appropriate. 
 
INSTALLATION OF FACILITIES. 
For a situation in which an extension of the Company's distribution system is necessary in order to provide 
standard electric service, the Company charges a deposit, as applicable, to recover costs of the extension.  
Such deposit is determined, charged, and paid in accordance with the terms of Rider DE.  Rider DE also 
includes provisions with respect to the refunding of such deposit. 
 
Nonstandard services and facilities are provided in accordance with the provisions of these General Terms 
and Conditions, other tariffs on file with the ICC, and the Company's current applicable unit costs for 
providing nonstandard services and facilities. 
 
For a situation in which underground distribution facilities are to be installed for a single family residential 
project with more than one (1) residential retail customer premises, the Company charges the developer of 
the project a refundable deposit for each premises before installation of the underground distribution 
facilities is started.  Each such deposit is refunded as each residential retail customer premises is 
connected to the Company's distribution system.  The amount refunded never exceeds the amount of the 
original deposit.  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this paragraph, any deposits not so refunded 
after ten (10) years following the installation of the distribution facilities become the property of the 
Company. 
 
For a situation in which an underground system is requested for a group of individual residential retail 
customer premises, the Company does not allocate any applicable charges among the individual retail 
customers.  Instead, such retail customers, acting as a group, must make a single payment for the total 
charges applicable to all the affected premises. 
 
For a situation in which a proposed residential development, including but not limited to, individual 
detached residences, mobile homes, lots in a recreational park, apartment building complexes in which 
each building has fewer than four (4) units, or rowhouse developments, has an average lot line length 
along the route of the a proposed underground distribution system that exceeds 125 feet, the Company 
charges a flat rate per foot charge for additional cable required in excess of the average 125 feet per lot.  
In addition, any necessary cable riser on a Company pole is provided in accordance with the provisions for 
providing nonstandard services and facilities. 
 
For a situation in which a building project is planned for more than one (1) nonresidential retail customer, 
and such project requires the Company to provide nonstandard facilities, the Company charges the 
developer of the project for the cost of such nonstandard facilities.  Notwithstanding the previous 
provisions of this paragraph, for a situation in which there is no developer, and nonstandard facilities are 
required by a nonresidential retail customer at a premises in such project, the Company charges the 
nonresidential retail customer for the cost of such nonstandard facilities.

INSTALLATION OF FACILITIES (CONTINUED). 
  For a situation in which the AMI Metering subsection of the Standard Metering section of the Metering part 
of these General Terms and Conditions is applicable to a retail customer and non AMI metering had been 
installed, replaced, or exchanged at such premises since the date that such AMI Metering subsection 
became applicable to such retail customer, the subsequent installation of AMI metering is performed in 
accordance with the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions, other tariffs on file with the ICC, 
and the Company's current applicable unit costs for installing nonstandard services and facilities. 
 
  For a situation in which (a) service under Rider NAM - Non AMI Metering (Rider NAM) is terminated for a 
retail customer as a result of the installation of AMI metering by the Company at such retail customer’s 
premises and (b) such retail customer had been subjected to the meter reading charges listed in the 
Monthly Charges section of such rider prior to such termination, the Company provides a credit to such 
retail customer in an amount equal to the total meter reading charge that had been listed on such retail 
customer’s last monthly bill for electric service issued prior to such termination. 
 
CONTINUING ELECTRIC SERVICE. 
*  Except as provided in (a) the Electronic Billing subsection of this Continuing Electric Service section and 
(b) Rider SBO, the Company issues monthly bills containing charges for the provision of electric service on 
paper via United States mail. 
 
  Monthly Billing Periods 
For purposes of counting the number of days in a retail customer's monthly billing period, the monthly 
billing period (a) ends on the Company’s regularly scheduled meter reading or data acquisition date to 
compile meter usage data for regularly scheduled electric service billing purposes for such retail 
customer which occurs during the designated month of the Company’s monthly billing cycle schedule 
and (b) begins on the day after the Company’s regularly scheduled meter reading or data acquisition 
date to compile meter usage data for regularly scheduled electric service billing purposes for such 
retail customer during the Company’s prior monthly billing cycle.  The scheduled monthly billing cycle 
date is counted as the end day in the monthly billing period and not the start day.  By way of example, 
a retail customer’s August monthly billing period begins the day after the Company’s regularly 
scheduled monthly billing cycle date for the retail customer occurring in the Company’s July monthly 
billing cycle and ends on the Company’s regularly scheduled monthly billing cycle date for such retail 
customer occurring in the Company’s August monthly billing cycle. 
 
Due to holidays and weekends, the Company's twelve (12) monthly billing cycles do not necessarily 
coincide with their corresponding calendar months.  For example, the first monthly billing cycle date for 
the April monthly billing cycle may occur on March 31.  As a result, for a retail customer for which the 
regularly scheduled monthly billing cycle date is the first date of the monthly billing cycle, such retail 
customer’s April monthly billing period reflects usage that was provided on or before March 31 
because that is the retail customer’s regularly scheduled monthly billing cycle date for the April 
monthly billing cycle.

Electronic Billing 
A retail customer may voluntarily elect to be billed through a paperless electronic billing system using 
standard forms and protocols established and maintained by the Company.  In administering this 
electronic billing option, the Company does not send such retail customer paper bills.  Required 
information that otherwise accompanies a paper bill is transmitted to such retail customer 
electronically, or the Internet link access to such information is transmitted electronically to such retail 
customer.  Any applicable disconnection notice continues to be sent to such retail customer via United 
States mail.  The Company may utilize unaffiliated third parties to electronically transmit bills to such 
retail customer.  The Company is not responsible for any loss resulting from such retail customer's 
election to receive bills electronically, including but not limited to, any loss associated with damage to 
the retail customer's computer equipment or facilities and any loss associated with a third party's 
unauthorized use of such retail customer's information.  Either the Company or such retail customer 
may, upon thirty (30) days notice to the other party, terminate electronic transmission of bills without 
any liability to the terminating party resulting from such termination, and without affecting such retail 
customer’s obligation to pay all amounts due the Company.  In such event, the Company begins to 
issue paper bills via United States mail to such retail customer as soon as reasonably practical.  The 
Company reserves the right to determine whether or not a retail customer is eligible to be billed 
through its paperless electronic system.  The provisions of this Electronic Billing subsection are not 
applicable to a retail customer that receives bills for electric service from a RES pursuant to 
Rider SBO. 
 
Measurement of Energy and Demand 
*  Generally, on a monthly billing period basis, the Company compiles meter usage data measurements 
of the electricity, in kWhs, provided to a retail customer, and as applicable, the maximum demand 
established by such retail customer, which is the maximum thirty (30) minute rate, in kWs, at which 
electricity is provided to such retail customer and the MKD established by such retail customer.  These 
measurements are applied, as applicable, to unit charges included in the Company's tariffs on file with 
the ICC to develop monthly charges applicable to such retail customer. 
 
For a situation in which the demand register for a metering installation is an interval demand recording 
register, the thirty (30) minute periods over which electricity is measured begin at either the beginning 
of the hour (XX:00) or at the half-hour (XX:30) and end thirty (30) minutes later at (XX:30) or 
(XX+1:00), respectively. 
 
For a situation in which there are two (2) or more watt-hour metering installations at a retail customer’s 
premises, the kWhs provided to such retail customer are determined by adding together the kWhs 
metered at each such metering installation. 
 
For a situation in which the Company elects to provide no metering installation in the provision of 
electric service to a nonresidential retail customer because such retail customer uses electric service 
on a continuous or regularly scheduled basis that does not exceed two (2) kW, the kWhs provided to 
such retail customer during a monthly billing period are determined by multiplying the total rated or 
nameplate wattage of the retail customer's electrical equipment by the hours such equipment is 
operated during the monthly billing period, and dividing such product by one thousand (1,000).

Measurement of Energy and Demand (Continued) 
For a situation in which the Company elects to provide no metering installation in the provision of 
electric service to a nonresidential retail customer because such retail customer uses electric service 
for qualifying CATV facilities, the kWhs provided to such retail customer are initially based upon 50% 
of the nameplate wattage of the retail customer's CATV transformers connected to the Company's 
system, but are subsequently able to be determined by test at the Company’s option or upon the 
request of such retail customer.  The Company must conduct such test within a reasonable period of 
time, based upon the number of CATV facilities to be tested, after receiving the request for such test.  
The kWhs provided to such retail customer as determined by such test, are used prospectively only, 
beginning with the monthly billing period following the test and continuing until changed by a 
subsequent test or other appropriate data. 
 
For a situation in which there are two (2) or more interval demand recording metering installations at a 
retail customer’s premises, the demand established by such retail customer in any thirty (30) minute 
period is determined by adding together the separate demands established at each metering 
installation during such thirty (30) minute period.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous 
sentence, for a situation in which the demand register for a metering installation is not an interval 
demand recording register, the demand established at such metering installation in each thirty (30) 
minute period of any monthly billing period is assumed to be the same as the highest demand 
established in any thirty (30) minute period of such monthly billing period.

Measurement of Energy and Demand (Continued)  
For a situation in which either the Dusk to Dawn Lighting Delivery Class or the General Lighting 
Delivery Class is applicable to a retail customer, the kWhs furnished to such retail customer in a 
monthly billing period is normally determined on the basis of (a) the rated wattage of the light sources 
and auxiliaries connected at the beginning of such monthly billing period, (b) divided by one thousand 
(1,000), and (c) multiplied by either (1) the average monthly burning hours, with such average 
computed over a twelve (12) monthly billing period timeframe, or (2) the burning hours in such monthly 
billing period, as applicable.  The retail customer must give the Company prior written notice of 
changes in the wattage and operating schedules of electrical equipment for which the Company is 
providing electric service.  The Company has the right from time to time to inspect and make tests of 
such retail customer's electrical equipment to confirm the values used in the determination of such 
kWhs.  For a situation in which it is not practical to determine the kWhs provided to the retail customer 
in the aforementioned manner, such kWhs are determined on the basis of a representative test, by 
metering, or by another reasonable method. 
 
For a situation in which the Fixture-Included Lighting Delivery Class is applicable to a retail customer, 
the kWhs provided to such retail customer during a monthly billing period is determined on the basis 
of (a) the rated wattage of the light sources and auxiliaries connected at the beginning of such 
monthly billing period, (b) divided by one thousand (1,000), and (c) multiplied by the average monthly 
burning hours, with such average computed over a twelve (12) monthly billing period timeframe. 
 
For a situation in which a retail customer installs, owns, and maintains its own metering equipment for 
purposes of demand control or other reasons and such metering equipment is in parallel with the 
Company’s meter-related facilities, only the Company's meter-related facilities are used for the 
measurement of electricity delivered to and demand established by such retail customer. 
 
For a situation in which a retail customer installs, owns, and maintains its own metering equipment for 
purposes of demand control or other reasons and such metering equipment is in parallel with an 
MSP’s metering equipment that is installed, owned, operated, and maintained in accordance with 
Rate RDS and Rate MSPS, only the MSP's metering equipment is used for the measurement of 
electricity delivered to and demand established by such retail customer. 
 
The kWhs, and kWs as applicable, delivered to two or more noncontiguous premises are not 
combined for billing purposes except for a retail customer (a) to which the Railroad Delivery Class is 
applicable, (b) to which the General Lighting Delivery Class is applicable, or (c) that uses electric 
service for dusk to dawn public street lighting.

Measurement of Energy and Demand (Continued)  
In providing energy and demand measurements to a RES for a retail customer for which such RES 
provides electric power and energy supply service, the Company provides information with respect to 
the sixty (60) minute demands established by such retail customer in the following manner, as 
applicable: 
 
a.  For a situation in which an interval demand recording metering installation is provided for such 
retail customer, the average of the interval demand recording meter's data for the two (2) thirty 
(30) minute intervals within each hour is used to determine such sixty (60) minute demand. 
 
b.  For a situation in which no metering installation or a metering installation that does not have an 
interval demand recording register is provided for the retail customer, the sixty (60) minute 
demands established by the retail customer are statistically derived utilizing the load profile 
applicable to the retail customer, as such profile may be adjusted or modified pursuant to the 
Company’s standard methodology for determination of load profiles, and the kWhs delivered 
during the monthly billing period, as determined for such retail customer or measured via such 
metering installation, as applicable. 
 
*  c.  For a situation in which two (2) or more metering installations are provided for such retail 
customer, the demand established by such retail customer in any sixty (60) minute period is 
determined by adding together the separate demands determined for each metering installation, in 
accordance with the aforementioned items (a) and (b), during such sixty (60) minute period. 
 
  Estimation of Energy and Demand  
  For a Company-provided metering installation at a retail customer premises, in the event the Company 
does not measure the electricity delivered to a retail customer and/or, as applicable, the maximum 
demand for electricity established by such retail customer associated with such metering installation in 
accordance with the provisions of the Measurement of Energy and Demand subsection of this 
Continuing Electric Service section, the Company must estimate such electricity delivered and/or 
maximum demand for electricity established in accordance with the applicable provisions of this 
Estimation of Energy and Demand subsection. 
 
  For a situation pertaining to a Company-provided metering installation at the retail customer premises 
for which the measurements to determine the electricity delivered to a retail customer and/or the 
maximum demands established by such retail customer are scheduled to be made at regular intervals 
of time that are shorter in duration than a monthly billing period, the requirement in subsection 
410.200(e) of the 83 Illinois Administrative Code, as applicable, to limit any estimation performed in 
accordance with the provisions of this Estimation of Energy and Demand subsection for such metering 
installation to twice such regular interval is waived in accordance with the ICC’s Order in Docket 
No. 16-0025.

Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Estimation of Energy and Demand subsection, the 
following provisions of this Estimation of Energy and Demand subsection are applicable for certain 
retail customers, determined at the Company’s discretion, for which the Company is providing AMI 
metering, in order for the Company to review the functionality of the meter data management system 
and related processes being implemented in support of its deployment of AMI metering. 
 
In accordance with the processes being implemented in support of the Company’s deployment of AMI 
metering, meter usage data from each AMI meter are transmitted to the aforementioned meter data 
management system on a daily basis.  For each AMI meter, such meter usage data are expected to 
include forty-eight (48) measurements of the kWh delivered during each thirty (30) minute interval 
during the previous calendar day.  For the purposes of the following provisions in this Estimation of 
Energy and Demand subsection, any such thirty (30) minute measurement is identified as an interval 
reading.  Such meter usage data are also expected to include a separately determined kWh amount 
delivered over the entire twenty-four (24) hour period based upon the meter’s kWh registration at the 
end of the day.  For the purposes of the following provisions in this Estimation of Energy and Demand 
subsection, any such kWh amount determined for an entire twenty-four (24) hour day is identified as a 
scalar reading.  
 
For the purposes of the following provisions in this Estimation of Energy and Demand subsection, 
January 1, the last Monday in May, July 4, the first Monday in September, the fourth Thursday in 
November, and December 25 are considered holidays.  In addition, if any such holiday occurs on a 
Sunday, the immediately following Monday is also considered a holiday. 
 
For the purposes of the following provisions in this Estimation of Energy and Demand subsection, for a 
situation in which a scalar reading or an interval reading is missing as a result of a known interruption 
of electric service for the twenty-four (24) hour period for which the scalar reading is missing or the 
thirty (30) minute period for which the interval reading is missing, the following estimation procedures 
are not used and such scalar reading or interval reading, as applicable, is determined to be 
zero (0) kWh.

  For a situation in which a retail customer requires temporary service, the Company may elect to use 
applicable flat rate charges, rather than charging in accordance with Rider NS, for providing the 
nonstandard services and facilities necessary to provide such temporary service, provided such flat 
rate charges do not exceed the Company's unit costs for such services and facilities. 
 
For a situation in which a retail customer requests seasonal service, the Company may elect to use 
applicable flat rate charges, rather than charging in accordance with Rider NS, for providing the 
nonstandard services and facilities necessary to provide such seasonal service, provided such flat rate 
charges do not exceed the Company's unit costs for such services and facilities.  In addition, the 
Company charges the retail customer an amount equal to the sum of the applicable Customer 
Charges for the monthly billing periods during which electric service is disconnected.  Reconnection is 
not performed until the retail customer pays such amount to the Company. 
 
In the provision of nonstandard additional facilities for fixture-included lighting installations used by the 
retail customer for private outdoor lighting purposes, the Company provides such facilities at a monthly 
charge of 2.1% of the Company's cost to furnish and install such facilities.  In determining the amount 
of such monthly charge, the Company may use unit prices for such facilities as the cost base, provided 
that such unit prices are at or below the Company's average unit costs for such facilities. 
 
  For a situation in which the Company provides a fixture-included lighting unit for a retail customer that 
uses such lighting unit for private outdoor lighting purposes, and such lighting unit is removed from 
service at such retail customer's request after a period of time that is less than twenty-four (24) months 
following the installation of such lighting unit, the Company has the right to charge such retail customer 
(a) the applicable Distribution Facilities Charge listed in the Delivery Service Charges Informational 
Sheets of the Company’s Schedule of Rates for such unit, multiplied by (b) the difference between 
twenty-four (24) and the number of months that the unit was in place. 
 
In the provision of nonstandard additional facilities for fixture-included lighting installations used by the 
retail customer for public street lighting purposes, the Company provides such facilities at either (a) a 
monthly charge of 2.1% of the Company's cost to furnish and install such facilities, or (b) a lump sum 
payment prior to installation equal to the Company's cost to furnish and install such facilities plus a 
monthly charge of 0.9% of such cost to furnish and install such facilities.  In determining the amount of 
such monthly charge, the Company may use unit prices for such facilities as the cost base, provided 
that such unit prices are at or below the Company's average unit costs for such facilities.  The retail 
customer for which such nonstandard facilities are provided must elect one of the payment methods 
described in the aforementioned items (a) and (b).  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this 
paragraph, the retail customer may elect to furnish such facilities itself.  In the event of such election, 
the Company charges such retail customer a monthly charge of 0.9% of the cost that would be 
incurred by the Company to furnish and install comparable facilities.

In the event that a residential retail customer or nonresidential retail customer to which the Watt-Hour 
or Small Load Delivery Class applies and that is an owner of a multifamily residential or mixed-use 
building with no more than fifty (50) residential units participates in an on-bill financing program that is 
approved by the ICC and provided in accordance with the provisions of Section 16-111.7 of the Act, 
then the Company must include any applicable on-bill financing program charges attributable to such 
retail customer on monthly bills for electric service provided by the Company to such retail customer.  
Any such charge must be shown as a separate line item on any such monthly bill. 
 
Interruption of Service 
A retail customer is entitled to a reduction in monthly billing charges for electric service equal to the 
applicable Customer Charge for any monthly billing period in which electric service to such retail 
customer is interrupted for a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive hours due to (a) a malfunction 
of Company equipment not caused by weather or the actions of a RES or an MSP; (b) an error by a 
Company employee or Company contractor; (c) an accident involving a Company employee or 
Company contractor; (d) damage to Company equipment caused by a Company employee or 
Company contractor; or (e) overloaded Company distribution equipment not caused by retail customer 
negligence.  If the duration of any such interruption resulting from any of the causes identified in items 
(a) through (e) is at least twenty-four (24) consecutive hours, or if there is more than one such 
interruption of at least twelve (12) consecutive hours in a monthly billing period, the retail customer is 
entitled to an additional reduction in monthly billing charges equal to the applicable Customer Charge 
for such monthly billing period multiplied by the number of increments of twelve (12) consecutive hours 
of interruption in excess of the first such twelve (12) consecutive hours.  In applying this provision in a 
monthly billing period in which the applicable Customer Charge changes, the Customer Charge in 
effect at the start of the outage in question is used.  The reduction described in this paragraph does 
not include charges billed to the retail customer in accordance with the provisions of Rider RCA - 
Retail Customer Assessments (Rider RCA), and the billing charges continue to include charges 
applied to the retail customer in the monthly billing period in accordance with Rider RCA. 
 
For a situation in which service for a fixture-included lighting unit is interrupted, the affected retail 
customer notifies the Company of the interruption promptly, and the Company does not restore service 
to such unit within seven (7) days after such notification, the Company must make a pro rata 
abatement of the billing charges for the period of the interruption on the retail customer's monthly bill.

Payments by the Company 
For a situation in which the Company requires a retail customer to accept a change in the voltage 
entering the retail customer's premises to permit the Company to serve the retail customer more 
economically, the Company is responsible for the cost of facilities required to accommodate such 
change in accordance with the following rules: 
 
1.  The Company's responsibility is limited to facilities used to provide electric service to such retail 
customer in accordance with the highest MKD established by such retail customer within three (3) 
years prior to the Company's requirement for the change in voltage.  Such demand is designated 
as the cost basis demand. 
 
2.  The retail customer is responsible for all costs associated with facilities required to solely serve 
any additional expected or proposed electric power and energy requirements or facilities with 
incidental usefulness for the cost basis demand. 
 
3.  The responsibility for costs associated with facilities required to serve such cost basis demand and 
additional expected or proposed electric power and energy requirements of the retail customer are 
shared by the Company and the retail customer.  The Company's percentage share of such 
responsibility is equal to (a) the cost basis demand taken as a percentage of (b) the sum of the 
cost basis demand and the retail customer's additional expected or proposed electric power and 
energy requirements at such location. 
 
4.  Notwithstanding the aforementioned provisions in item (1), item (2), and item (3), the retail 
customer is responsible for the installation, ownership, and maintenance of such retail customer's 
facilities. 
 
5.  All costs are determined based upon the most economical service plan, as determined by the 
Company.  
 
6.  All cost computations include appropriate allowances for salvage available from facilities on the 
retail customer's premises to be replaced.  In lieu of paying the retail customer for the cost of 
facilities that the retail customer requires for electric service at existing points of delivery, the 
Company may transfer to the retail customer, in serviceable condition, facilities on such retail 
customer's premises previously used by the Company to provide such service. 
 
7.  No payment is made by the Company for land required for placement of facilities. 
 
8.  The retail customer remains responsible for any charges assessed in the provision of nonstandard 
services and facilities. 
 
*  In accordance with the provisions of certain of the tariffs included in its Schedule of Rates the Company 
makes payments to retail customers.  Such payments are made in accordance with the provisions of such

ELECTRIC ENERGY CONTINGENCY PLAN 
 
The provisions of this Electric Energy Contingency Plan part are implemented in the event of shortages of 
electric power and energy arising from long-term energy or capacity shortages.  The provisions do not 
apply in the event of short-term shortages of adequate capacity to meet loads during emergency 
conditions of only a few hours' duration, and in any event do not prevent the Company, and/or PJM, from 
taking whatever steps are necessary, at any time, in whatever order, and with or without notice, to 
preserve the integrity of the electric delivery system located in the Company's service territory and the 
interconnected transmission network. 
 
In the event of any such developing long-term shortage of electric power and energy, the Company and/or 
PJM first takes steps deemed appropriate to obtain additional sources of electric power and energy and 
the Company applies any appropriate electric power and energy conservation measures to its own 
operation, to the extent possible, without reducing personnel and system efficiency.  The Company also, to 
the extent possible, employs voltage reductions, as directed by PJM, that do not intentionally exceed eight 
percent (8%) to reduce energy use, and to the extent permitted by applicable tariff provisions, require retail 
customers with interruptible or curtailable electric service provisions to reduce their electrical consumption.  
If practical, the Company notifies its retail customers by appropriate media announcements twenty-four 
(24) hours in advance of any planned nominal voltage reduction in excess of five percent (5%). 
 
If the preceding measures are inadequate or are likely to be inadequate in alleviating the electric power 
and energy shortage, the Company notifies the Office of the Chief Clerk of the ICC and the ICC's Energy 
Division, Engineering Section of the present status of the shortage, measures that have been taken by the 
Company and/or PJM, what the Company and/or PJM plans to do, and what the public can do on a 
voluntary basis to alleviate the shortage.  The Company may, if it believes appropriate, and before or after 
such notice to the ICC, survey some or all of its largest nonresidential retail customers to determine if any 
such retail customers are planning a reduction in electricity use for other reasons, and what other 
measures could be taken to reduce such electricity use.  The Company may, but only after twenty-four 
(24) hour advance notice to the ICC, make public appeals for voluntary curtailment of electricity use.  Any 
means of communication that the Company believes appropriate, ranging from mass media to individual 
retail customer contact, may be employed, and the Company may make appropriate suggestions to the 
public concerning measures that can be taken to reduce electricity use.

ELECTRIC ENERGY CONTINGENCY PLAN (CONTINUED) 
 
If the aforementioned measures fail to alleviate the shortage of electric power and energy, the Company, 
upon twenty-four (24) hour notice to the ICC, implements a plan of mandatory curtailment.  In 
implementing such mandatory curtailment plan as directed by PJM, the Company (a) publicly notifies retail 
customers of the required curtailment amount via media communications it considers appropriate; (b) 
individually notifies each retail customer with a demand for electric power of at least 1,500 kW of the 
required curtailment amount via telephone, with confirmation in writing; and (c) provides a list of such 
individually notified retail customers to the ICC.  Such required curtailment amount is expressed as a 
percentage of electricity use for an appropriate base period that preceded appeals for voluntary 
curtailment.  The Company's initial notice of mandatory curtailment cannot set the required curtailment 
amount in excess of thirty percent (30%).  However, if the Company and/or PJM subsequently determines 
that a greater required curtailment amount than that initially specified is necessary, it notifies retail 
customers of such greater required curtailment amount after providing twenty-four (24) hour notice to the 
ICC.  Any such subsequent notification is implemented in accordance with the communication 
mechanisms used for the initial notification. 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in the Company's Schedule of Rates or 83 Illinois Administrative 
Code, if a retail customer does not comply with a mandatory curtailment of electricity use such retail 
customer is subject to disconnection of electric service, upon forty-eight (48) hours notice to such retail 
customer and to the ICC's Energy Division, Engineering Section.  Such disconnection is effective for the 
duration of the period of mandatory curtailment, unless the retail customer presents a plan for compliance 
and complies with the mandatory curtailment then in effect.  The ICC's Energy Division, Engineering 
Section is notified of the restoration of electric service to each retail customer disconnected for failure to 
comply with the required mandatory curtailment.  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this 
paragraph, curtailment is not required to the extent that it seriously jeopardizes essential services as 
described in this Electric Energy Contingency Plan part.   
 
As a part of any plan of mandatory curtailment the Company may implement a plan of rotating 
interruptions of its distribution system circuits after providing twenty-four (24) hours notice to the ICC.  
Such rotating interruptions should avoid interruption of circuits providing electric service for essential 
services, to the extent necessary and practical.  Such rotating interruptions are limited to no more than 
three (3) hours at a time and to no more than nine (9) hours per day for any circuit.  To the extent possible, 
the Company provides advance notification to retail customers via public media of the times at which 
electric service may be interrupted.  The Company must maintain a current record of retail customer 
premises at which respirators, kidney dialysis units, and other similar life support equipment dependent 
upon electricity are used, and to the extent possible avoid interruption of electric service to such retail 
customers unless prior precautions to protect their health and safety have been taken.

ELECTRIC ENERGY CONTINGENCY PLAN (CONTINUED) 
 
As used in this Electric Energy Contingency Plan part, essential services are those services or activities 
requiring the use of electricity for the protection of the public health, safety, or security, or to aid in 
alleviating the electricity shortage.  A retail customer providing essential services is exempt from 
mandatory curtailment requirements only to the extent necessary to provide those services, and is not 
necessarily exempt from inclusion in a plan of rotating interruptions of distribution system circuits.  Such 
inclusion may, for example, occur because the Company has no knowledge that such retail customer is 
connected to a particular circuit or because the importance of interrupting a particular circuit in order to 
distribute more fairly the burden of achieving needed curtailment outweighs the importance of 
uninterrupted provision of electricity to any such retail customer on such circuit.  A retail customer located 
at a premises with facilities included in the following list is considered to be providing essential services: 
 
1.  facilities providing life support services, including but not limited to, a) hospitals, b) convalescent 
homes, or c) locations at which respirators, kidney dialysis units, and other similar equipment are 
used; 
 
2.  facilities providing national, state, or local security services, including but not limited to a) missile sites, 
b) defense communication network centers, c) civil defense facilities, d) prisons, or e) other 
governmental facilities essential for national defense or emergency services; 
 
3.  facilities providing public health and safety services, including but not limited to a) law enforcement 
and fire control facilities, b) traffic signal and control and highway lighting facilities, c) public utility 
facilities, including those providing electricity, natural or manufactured gas, garbage collection, water, 
and sewage disposal, d) operation, guidance control, and navigation facilities for public transportation 
and shipping, including rail, mass transit, and commercial air and water transportation, e) 
communication facilities, including telephone, telegraph, radio, and television, or f) medical and food 
supply facilities; 
 
4.  facilities used in the production and distribution of energy resources, including but not limited to a) coal 
mining and transportation facilities, b) facilities for the production, storage and distribution of natural or 
manufactured gas and petroleum fuels, c) facilities for the production, transmission and distribution of 
electricity, d) construction of facilities that would aid in alleviating the instant electricity shortage. 
 
Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this paragraph, the listing of facilities engaged in providing 
essential services is subject to change by the ICC.

reduced in the following Delivery Year, X+1, by a credit provided to such customer’s ARES in an amount, 
in $, such that the RE Adjustment for Delivery Year X is equivalent to (a) the otherwise applicable RE 
Adjustment determined in accordance with the previous provisions of this Determination of the 
Renewable Energy Adjustment section multiplied by (b) 1 minus the following quotient: (c) the quantity of 
RECs supplied by such ARES divided by (d) such ARES’s target REC quantity, reduced by a computed 
share of RECs provided by Self-Direct Customers.  
 
  Such credit provided to such customers’ ARES must be determined by the Company by multiplying (a) 
the otherwise applicable RE Adjustment determined in accordance with the previous provisions of this 
Determination of the Renewable Energy Adjustment section by (b) the total ARES customer usage, 
reduced by IPA-approved customer usage for RECs supplied by Self-Direct Customers for Delivery Year 
X and multiplying (c) the quotient of (d) the quantity of RECs supplied by such ARES divided by (e) such 
ARES’s target REC quantity, reduced by a computed share of RECs provided by Self-Direct Customers. 
The total ARES customer usage for Delivery Year X must be the meter usage for such ARES.  The 
Company must electronically provide the total credit to each ARES that meets the requirements of items 
(i) through (iii) in subsection 1-75(c)(1)(H) of the IPA Act by September 1 in Delivery Year X+1.  Such 
ARES customers’ supply charges and any adjustments to supply charges must account for the value of 
the RECs supplied by an ARES that meets the requirements of items (i) through (iii) in subsection 1-
75(c)(1)(H) of the IPA Act such that the otherwise applicable RE Adjustment is the maximum such ARES 
customer would pay on a kWh basis for the applicable renewable portfolio standard, as described in the 
Alternative Retail Electric Supplier Supplied Renewable Energy Credits section of Rate RESS – Retail

Credit for Self-Direct Customers 
A Self-Direct Customer will receive a ¢/kWh credit for its purchase of RECs as determined pursuant 
to subsection 1-75(c)(1)(R) of the IPA Act.  The approved RECs procured by a Self-Direct customer 
will be converted to a kWh value for application on the Self-Direct Customer’s account or account(s) 
by multiplying the number of RECs times 1,000 and dividing by 12 for the monthly kWh amount.  For 
Self-Direct Customers with multiple accounts, the share of eligible kWhs will be spread proportionally 
across the multiple accounts based upon the annual kWhs used by each account.  Such credit will 
appear as a separate line item on the Self-Direct Customer’s bill as a dollar per kWh, by dividing the 
approved ¢/kWh amount by 100, rate multiplied by the associated kWhs. 
 
The Self-Direct Customer shall provide the Company with a notice containing the following IPA and 
ICC approved information to provide the ¢/kWh credit for the Self-Direct Customer: 
 
a.  The beginning and ending dates of the Self-Direct Customer’s long-term contract(s) for the 
purchase of RECs from new utility-scale wind or solar projects through long-term agreements 
with term lengths of at least 10-years consistent with all requirements in the IPA Act; 
 
b.  A copy of the ICC Order approving the ¢/kWh credit amount determined by the IPA for its 
purchase of RECs as determined pursuant to subsection 1-75(c)(1)(R) of the IPA Act; 
 
c.  A list of account numbers and addresses that qualify under the requirements to be eligible for a 
credit under the Self-Direct Renewable Portfolio Compliance Program.  The list shall indicate the 
year in which the application was filed and the aggregate highest 30-minute demand for the 12 
consecutive monthly billing periods in the calendar year prior to the year in which the self-direct 
application was filed; 
 
d.  The total number of RECs contracted by the Self-Direct Customer under its long-term contract(s) 
included in the Self-Direct Renewable Portfolio Compliance Program to which the Self-Direct 
Customer seeks a credit, by Delivery Year; and 
 
e.  No later than three (3) months after the end of the Delivery Year, the number of RECs retired by

Credit for Self-Direct Customers (Continued) 
The following ¢/kWh credits will be provided to a Self-Direct Customer for RECs purchased by, 
delivered to and retired by or on behalf of, such customer in an applicable Delivery Year: 
 
a.  Beginning with the monthly billing period that corresponds with the beginning of the next Delivery 
Year after submittal of its Self-Direct Customer application form, and approved by the IPA, a 
separate bill line-item credit will be applied to each Self-Direct Customer’s account or account(s).    
If the ICC has not approved the ¢/kWh bill credit amount for a given Delivery Year by the time the 
Company must apply the credit for the appropriate June monthly billing period, then the line-item 
bill credit amount shall be equivalent to the effective RE Adjustment.  At such time that the ICC 
approves the ¢/kWh credit amount for a given Delivery Year, the Company shall reflect such 
amount on the customer’s bill as soon as is practicable.   
 
Notwithstanding the previous receipt of the ICC approved credit amount, if a Self-Direct Customer 
does not receive its ICC approved total ¢/kWh credit amount for the Delivery Year because the 
RE Adjustment was applied in lieu of the ICC approved ¢/kWh value, the Company will collect the 
difference within four (4) monthly billing periods after the May monthly billing period of the 
Delivery Year.   
 
b.  Notwithstanding the previous provision, if a Self-Direct Customer receives a self-direct credit and 
the IPA determines the customer failed to properly procure and retire the RECs, the ICC, on 
petition from the IPA and after notice and hearing, may direct the Company to recover the cost of 
the wrongfully received self-direct credits plus interest.

*  DEFINITIONS. 
Generally, definitions of terms used in this rider are provided in the Definitions part of the General Terms 
and Conditions of the Company’s Schedule of Rates.  The following definitions are for use in this rider: 
 
Delivery Year 
Delivery year means the annual period beginning June 1 in one calendar year and extending through 
May 31 in the next calendar year.  
 
ZE Contracts 
Zero emission (ZE) contracts mean the ten (10) year contractual agreements under which zero 
emission credits (ZECs) are procured for the Company by the IPA with zero emission facilities in 
accordance with subsection 1-75(d-5) of the IPA Act. 
  
DETERMINATION OF THE ZERO EMISSION ADJUSTMENT. 
Beginning with the June 2017 monthly billing period, the Zero Emission (ZE) Adjustment is equal to 
0.195 cents per kilowatt-hour (¢/kWh). 
 
Beginning in calendar year 2018, for the monthly billing periods beginning with the June monthly billing 
period in calendar year X and extending through the May monthly billing period in calendar year X+1 
associated with the delivery year starting in calendar year X, after the IPA determines the payments the 
Company must make to zero emission facilities in accordance with applicable ZE contracts and publishes 
the associated payment calculations in accordance with the provisions of subsection 1-75(d-5)(1)(D) of 
the IPA Act, the Company must determine the ZE Adjustment, in ¢/kWh rounded to the thousandths of a 
cent, in accordance with the following equation:

Where:   
C  =  Costs, in dollars ($), equal to the sum of the expenditures the Company expects 
to incur associated with the procurement of ZECs during the months 
corresponding to the monthly billing periods during which the ZE Adjustment is 
applicable.  Such expenditures include, but are not limited to payments that the 
Company must make to zero emission facilities during the delivery year 
beginning in calendar year X in accordance with applicable ZE Contracts and 
reasonable costs the Company expects to incur as part of the zero emission 
procurement processes and to implement and comply with plans and processes 
approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) to effectuate subsection  
    1-75(d-5) of the IPA Act. Such costs the Company expects to incur as part of the 
zero emission procurement processes and to implement and comply with plans 
and processes approved by the ICC to effectuate subsection 1-75(d-5) of the IPA 
Act include but are not limited to costs of working capital used to arrange or 
procure zero emission credits, with such costs determined in a manner 
consistent with the methodology used to determine costs of working capital 
approved by the ICC in its order in the Company’s most recent rate or Rate 
DSPP – Delivery Service Pricing and Performance (Rate DSPP) annual update 
case, or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable.   
 
Including costs of working capital in the determination of the C provides for the 
recovery of costs the Company incurs for working capital used to arrange or 
procure ZECs, such as the funds required to finance the lag between the 
purchase of ZECs and the recovery of the costs of such resources from retail 
customers.  Such costs are determined in a manner consistent with the 
methodology used to determine costs of working capital approved by the ICC in 
its order in the Company’s most recent rate or Rate DSPP annual update case, 
or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable.  Such methodology is applied 
using a cost of capital equal to that established by the ICC in its order in such 
most recent case or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable.  All other data, 
including applicable leads and lags, are updated annually to reflect current zero 
emission credit procurement working capital costs.  Company representatives 
must review such calculated costs with personnel from the Accounting 
Department of the ICC Staff in accordance with the provisions of the Annual 
Review and Reconciliation section of this tariff.  A cost of capital established by 
the ICC in its order in such most recent case or as otherwise provided by law, as 
applicable, is applied in determining the costs of the working capital component 
of the AC, as defined in the Determination of the Zero Emission Adjustment 
section of this rider, only for ZECs that become applicable after the date of such

Generally, ZE Adjustments are determined in May each calendar year following the publication of 
applicable ZEC payment calculations by the IPA, as approved by the ICC, as applicable, for application 
during the monthly billing periods corresponding to the months in the delivery year starting in calendar 
year X.  Updates to such ZE Adjustments are subsequently determined in August of such calendar year

correction in an OA as determined by the Company or in accordance with an ICC Order issued in a 
proceeding as described in the Annual Review and Reconciliation section of this rider directing the 
Company to include an OA.  Moreover, the ZE Adjustment may be revised by the Company in 
accordance with this Determination of the Zero Emission Adjustment section if the Company determines 
such revised ZE Adjustment results in a better match between the Company’s applicable expected costs 
and its recovery of those costs.   
 
*  Each year on or before April 30, the Company must also determine if the ZE Adjustment determined in 
accordance with the aforementioned equation in this Determination of the Zero Emission Adjustment 
section must be reduced for application to kWhs delivered by the Company to retail customers to which 
the Exempt Group or Opt-out Group, as defined in the Definitions part of the General Terms and 
Conditions of the Company’s Schedule of Rates, is applicable in order to limit the annual estimated 
average net increase in electric service costs for the prior calendar year due to future energy investment 
costs, as determined in accordance with subsection 16-108(m)(2) of the Act, to no more than

DETERMINATION OF THE PERFORMANCE ADJUSTMENT. 
The PA determined in accordance with the provisions of this Determination of the PA section is 
incorporated into the determination of the ROE used to develop the Company’s annual net energy 
efficiency revenue requirement in accordance with the provisions of Rider EEPP.  Such performance 
adjustment, in basis point format as used in Section 8-103B of the Act, is determined each year, 
beginning in 2019, for the previous calendar year.  The last calendar year for which a PA is calculated is 
calendar year 2030.  
 
Performance Adjustment Determination for 2018 Through 2025 Performance 
For a situation during the period 2018 through 2025 in which the Company achieved less than 100% 
of the AAIG, the PA is determined in accordance with the following equation: 
  
 
PA  -8.0  100%- AL  
 
Where: 
AL  =  Achievement Level, in percent format, equal to the percentage of the AAIG achieved by 
the Company, rounded to the hundredths place. 
 
For a situation during the period 2018 through 2025 in which the Company achieved more than 100% 
of the AAIG, the PA is determined in accordance with the following equation: 
 
 
PA  8.0  AL-100%  
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous equation, if the AAIG was reduced in accordance with 
provisions of subsection 8-103B(f)(1) or subsection 8-103B(f)(2) of the Act, as applicable, the PA is 
determined in accordance with provisions of subsection 8-103B(g)(7)(A)(ii)(aa) or subsection 
8-103B(g)(7)(A)(ii)(bb) of the Act, as applicable.

RIDER ECR 
ENVIRONMENTAL COST RECOVERY ADJUSTMENT 
 
Applicable to All Rates Except Rate RESS and Rate MSPS 
 
OVERVIEW. 
An Environmental Cost Recovery Adjustment (ECR) is computed by the Company each year, and as 
otherwise applicable in accordance with the provisions of this rider, to recover all Incremental Costs, as 
defined in this Overview section, incurred by the Company in association with Environmental Activities 
associated with former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites, as defined in this Overview section.  Such 
ECR is applied to all kilowatt-hours (kWhs) delivered to retail customers for electric service in accordance 
with the provisions of this rider. 
 
Environmental Activities mean activities performed, conducted, or implemented by or for the Company that 
are related to remediation or other treatment of environmental contamination at or associated with former 
MGP sites that is subject to applicable federal, state, or local laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, the investigation, sampling, monitoring, testing, removal and response measures, disposal, 
storage, and operation and maintenance of remediation and treatment measures. 
 
*  Incremental Costs mean costs incurred by the Company in association with Environmental Activities and 
include, but are not limited to, (a) fees, charges, billings, assessments, land costs, including acquisition 
costs for land purchased solely for Environmental Activities, lease expenses, property taxes, insurance 
and maintenance, or other liabilities used for Environmental Activities; (b) costs or expenses associated 
with the pursuit of insurance or other cost recovery for Environmental Activities; (c) costs or expenses 
associated with judgments, orders or decisions, including settlements, by a court, a governmental agency 
or department, or other quasi-adjudicatory body concerning Environmental Activities; and (d) legal, 
litigation, and settlement costs and expenses associated with Environmental Activities.  An Incremental 
Cost is incurred on the date the work corresponding to the associated Environmental Activity is performed, 
or in the case of payments by the Company associated with judgments, orders or decisions, including 
settlements, by a court, a governmental agency or department, or other quasi-adjudicatory body 
concerning Environmental Activities, the date the payment is made.  Incremental Costs do not include (i) 
the costs the Company incurs arising out of personal injury claims from exposure to asbestos, (ii) land 
acquisition purchase costs incurred prior to August 22, 2009, (iii) expenses for wages and salaries of

RIDER ECR 
ENVIRONMENTAL COST RECOVERY ADJUSTMENT 
 
(Continued from Sheet No. 240) 
 
ECR COMPUTATION AND APPLICATION. 
The ECR is applied, in accordance with the provisions of this rider, to each kWh delivered to retail 
customers.  The total charge or credit billed in accordance with the provisions of this rider is separately 
stated on each retail customer's monthly bill.  The ECR is computed in accordance with the following 
equation: 
 
PC −NRIC + ARF + ORF 100 ¢
ECR = ×  
PE $1
 
Where: 
 
ECR  =  Environmental Cost Recovery Adjustment, in ¢/kWh rounded to the thousandths of a cent, is 
applied to each kWh delivered to each retail customer during the twelve (12) monthly billing 
periods, beginning with the January monthly billing period following the date that such ECR 
is filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) for informational purposes, to recover 
Incremental Costs, or in the case of a revised ECR, beginning with the monthly billing period 
following the date that such revised ECR is filed with the ICC for informational purposes and 
extending through the following December monthly billing period. 
 
PC  =  Projected Costs, in $, are equal to the projected Incremental Costs the Company expects to 
incur during the calendar year following the date that the ECR is filed with the ICC, or in the 
case of a revised ECR, during the period beginning with the month following the date that 
such revised ECR is filed with the ICC for informational purposes and extending through 
December 31. 
 
*  NRIC  =  Net Reimbursements of Incremental Costs, in $, are equal to (a) reimbursement funds from 
any source other than the application of ECRs, including funds from insurance recoveries, 
that are associated with Environmental Activities and that are received by the Company on 
or after January 2, 2007, and not otherwise credited through this rider, plus (b) proceeds 
from leases that are associated with Environmental Activities and that are received by the 
Company on or after January 2, 2007, plus (c) proceeds from land sales that are associated 
with Environmental Activities and that are received by the Company on or after August 22, 
2009, with respect to land acquired after August 22, 2009, less (d) any Incremental Costs 
that the Company incurred on or after January 2, 2007, to obtain recovery of such funds or 
such proceeds from leases that are not otherwise recovered through this rider, less (e) any 
Incremental Costs that the Company incurred on or after August 22, 2009, to obtain 
recovery of such proceeds from land sales that are not otherwise recovered through this 
rider.  To the extent such reimbursements or Incremental Costs are not known through 
December 31 due to the fact that the ECR is computed and filed with the ICC prior to 
December 31, NRIC includes reimbursements and costs the Company expects to receive or 
incur, respectively, through December 31.  In the case of a revised ECR, instead of a twelve 
(12) month period, the period is equivalent to the number of months for which the PC is 
determined and includes the months that extend through the end of the month prior to the 
monthly billing period during which such revised ECR becomes effective.

ECR COMPUTATION AND APPLICATION (CONTINUED). 
ARF  =  Automatic Reconciliation Factor, in $, is equal to the cumulative over collection or under 
collection resulting from the application of then applicable ECRs through the twelve (12) 
month period ending December 31 prior to such calendar year.  To the extent such ARF is 
not known through December 31 due to the fact that the ECR is computed and filed with the 
ICC prior to December 31, ARF is the cumulative over collection or under collection the 
Company expects through December 31.  In the case of a revised ECR, the ARF is equal to 
the cumulative over collection or under collection resulting from the application of then 
applicable ECRs through the end of the month prior to the monthly billing period during 
which such revised ECR becomes effective.   
 
ORF  =  Ordered Reconciliation Factor, in $, is equal to an amount ordered by the ICC to be 
refunded to or collected from retail customers. 
 
PE  =  Projected Energy, in kWh, is equal to a projection of the electric power and energy expected 
to be delivered during such calendar year, or in the case of a revised ECR, during the period 
beginning with the month following the date that such revised ECR is filed with the ICC for 
informational purposes and extending through December 31. 
 
Each year, on or before November 30, the Company files with the ICC, for informational purposes, the 
ECR, computed in accordance with the equation in this ECR Computation and Application section, that is 
to be applied to each kWh delivered to retail customers during the twelve (12) monthly billing periods 
beginning with the January monthly billing period following such filing. 
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous paragraph, an ECR may be revised by the Company if the 
Company determines a revised ECR results in a better match between ECR revenues and Incremental 
Costs.  The ECR must be revised in the event that insurance recoveries for a calendar year are greater 
than the sum of (a) the Incremental Costs incurred in such calendar year, and (b) the PC for the 
subsequent calendar year.  The Company must file with the ICC, for informational purposes, such revised 
ECR no later than the fifteenth day of the month immediately preceding the monthly billing period during 
which such revised ECR becomes effective.  The revised ECR is determined in accordance with the 
equation in this ECR Computation and Application section.

price for any land acquired solely for Environmental Activities, and any documentation used to 
demonstrate that the acquisition of such land served to minimize costs to retail customers, consistent with 
safety, reliability, and quality assurance.  
 
Unless otherwise ordered by the ICC, the Company must revise the ECR in accordance with the 
provisions of the ECR Computation and Application section of this rider to become effective beginning with 
the April monthly billing period following the date of the filing of such annual report.  Such revised ECR 
must reflect the ARF specified in such annual report.  The ICC may order a hearing to review any such 
annual report filed by the Company within 180 calendar days of the date of such annual filing.  All amounts 
previously credited or collected under this rider are subject to further adjustment through the ORF, as 
directed by the ICC following such review. 
 
INSURANCE RECOVERIES. 
In the event that insurance recoveries received in a calendar year are greater than the sum of (a) the 
Incremental Costs incurred in such calendar year, and (b) the PC for the subsequent calendar year, such 
recoveries are used to cover costs for the current calendar year and any ongoing Incremental Costs.  
Interest is credited to any unexpended insurance proceeds at the Company's currently effective after tax 
cost of capital as allowed by the ICC.

DEFINITIONS. 
*  Generally, definitions of terms used in this rider are provided in the Definitions part of the General Terms 
and Conditions of the Company’s Schedule of Rates.  The following definitions are for use in this rider. 
 
Costs 
  Costs mean the expenditures incurred by the Company in undertaking a project that it was directly or 
indirectly compelled to undertake by the Local Government Unit as described in the Overview section 
of this rider. Such Costs include the entire amount so recorded on the Company's books of account.  
Such Costs may be estimated, subject to adjustment to actual Costs as they become available. Costs 
of qualifying projects under the River Edge Redevelopment Zone Act (65 ILCS 115/10) include labor, 
material and all indirect costs to engineer, remove, relocate, replace and install facilities, but do not 
include any environmental remediation costs.  For projects qualifying under the River Edge 
Redevelopment Zone Act, such Costs may be amortized as mutually agreed by the Company and the 
Local Government Unit for a reasonable period that is shorter than the life of the affected facility or 
facilities for the purpose of extending the time period over which the Company recovers such Costs in 
order to mitigate impacts on retail customer bills for electric service.  If so amortized, such Costs must 
include carrying costs at the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital most recently approved by the 
ICC in an effective final order establishing the Company’s ICC jurisdictional delivery service revenue 
requirement and corresponding delivery service charges. Costs do not include expenditures incurred 
by the Company that are recovered under Rider NS - Nonstandard Services and Facilities (Rider NS). 
 
Determination Month 
  Determination Month means the calendar month through which Costs and Revenues are accumulated 
and balanced in the Local Government Compliance Account.  The Determination Month is the month 
two (2) months prior to the monthly billing period for which the Local Government Compliance 
Adjustment (LGC) is computed. 
 
Local Government Unit 
Local Government Unit means any county, municipality, township, special district, or unit designated 
as a unit of local government by law and which exercises limited governmental powers or powers in 
respect to limited governmental subjects. 
 
Revenues 
Revenues mean cumulative amounts charged to retail customers located within the boundaries of the 
Local Government Unit for a project under this rider, less cumulative amounts credited to such retail 
customers for such project. 
 
ADJUSTMENT COMPUTATION AND APPLICATION. 
  As applicable, the LGC is applied, in accordance with the provisions of this rider, to kilowatt-hours (kWhs) 
provided to retail customers during the monthly billing period.  The total charge or credit billed in 
accordance with the provisions of this rider is separately stated on each such retail customer's bill.  The 
LGC is computed in accordance with the following equation: 
 
A P 100¢
LGC   
E $1
Where: 
 
LGC  =  Local Government Compliance Adjustment, in ¢/kWh rounded to the thousandths of a cent, 
applied to each kWh provided during the monthly billing period to each retail customer located 
within the boundaries of the Local Government Unit to recover the Costs attributable to such 
Local Government Unit, with such LGC equal to a charge or credit, as applicable.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMPLIANCE ADJUSTMENT 
 
(Continued from Sheet No. 254) 
 
ADJUSTMENT COMPUTATION AND APPLICATION (CONTINUED). 
A  =  Local Government Compliance Account Amount, in $, equal to the net balance of the cumulative 
Costs attributable to the Local Government Unit less Revenues from retail customers located 
within the boundaries of such Local Government Unit through the end of the Determination 
Month. 
 
P  =  Pending Revenues, in $, equal to the estimated amount of revenues charged or credited in 
accordance with the provisions of this rider to retail customers located within the boundaries of 
the Local Government Unit for the monthly billing period immediately prior to the monthly billing 
period for which the LGC is computed. 
 
E  =  Energy, in kWh, equal to the sum of the kWhs estimated to be provided during the monthly 
billing period for which the LGC is computed to retail customers located within the boundaries of 
the Local Government Unit for which the LGC is computed. 
 
*  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Adjustment Computation and Application section, the Local 
Government Unit may elect to limit the value of the LGC to equal no more than the expected average LGC 
for service provided for a project under this rider, as described in items (a) through (f) in the Overview 
section of this rider, with the determination of such expected average LGC based on a time period that 
extends for no more than two (2) months beyond the expected completion of the project.  A Local 
Government Unit is allowed to make such election provided the value of such expected average LGC is 
equal to or greater than 0.001¢/kWh.  The expected average LGC may be revised in the event that the 
costs for service provided for a project under this rider change significantly from those used to determine 
the original expected average LGC.  For a situation in which the Local Government Unit makes such 
election, it must notify the Company of its election at the time that it notifies the Company to provide such 
service for such project. 
 
If service provided for a project under this rider, as described in items (a) through (f) in the Overview 
section of this rider, has been completed for a period of three (3) months and calculation of the LGC 
results in a charge or credit of less than 0.001¢/kWh for three (3) consecutive monthly billing periods, then 
the balance in the Local Government Compliance Account is reduced to zero through an adjustment 
recorded on the Company's books of account, provided that the LGC equaled or exceeded 0.001¢/kWh at 
least once for the project.  Upon such adjustment of the Local Government Compliance Account to zero, 
any LGC previously determined for such project is not applied for purposes of back billing, bill 
adjustments, or any other purposes whatsoever. 
 
If service provided for a project under this rider, as described in items (a) through (f) in the Overview 
section of this rider, has been completed for a period of three (3) months and calculation of the LGC 
results in a charge or credit of less than 0.001¢/kWh for three (3) consecutive monthly billing periods, but 
the LGC never equaled or exceeded 0.001¢/kWh for the project, then no further LGCs are computed and 
applied with respect to such project, and the balance in the Local Government Compliance Account 
attributable to such project is added to the Local Government Compliance Account for the next project 
billed under this rider for such Local Government Unit.

CBBF  =  Consolidated Billing Balancing Factor, in $, equal to the cumulative debit or credit 
balance resulting from the application of the CB Adjustment through the previous POR 
Application Period.  Such balance includes interest at the rate established by the ICC

for reconciliation between revenues resulting from the previously applied CB 
Adjustment and applicable BSMICs and BSAOCs, as determined by the ICC during 
the reconciliation proceeding described in the Audit, Reporting, and Reconciliation 
Requirements section of Rider PORCB.  Such adjustment includes interest at the rate 
established by the ICC in accordance with 83 Illinois Administrative Code Section 
280.40(g)(1).  Such interest is determined for the period of time beginning on the day 
following the end of the POR Application Period for which the CBOR was determined 
and extending through the final date that the CBOR is applied.  No CBOR is 
applicable during the initial POR Application Period. 
 
EB   =  Expected Bills, equal to the number of bills the Company expects to issue to retail 
CB
customers to which the CB Adjustment is applicable during the period of time that the 
CB Adjustment is applied. 
 
Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Consolidated Billing Adjustment section, for POR 
Application Periods that end after December 31, 2022, CB Adjustments may not include BSMICs.  
 
Such CB Adjustment is included on a retail customer's monthly bills provided such retail customer is (a) a 
residential retail customer, (b) a nonresidential retail customer to which the (i) Watt-Hour Delivery Class, 
(ii) Small Load Delivery Class, or (iii) Medium Load Delivery Class is applicable, or (c) a lighting retail

than 400 kW. 
 
No later than the twentieth day of the month prior to the start of the monthly billing period during which the 
Company begins to issue bills that include a CB Adjustment, the Company must file such CB Adjustment, 
accompanied by supporting work papers, as necessary, with the ICC for informational purposes.  Any 
submission of a CB Adjustment for filing after the twentieth day of a month but prior to the start of such 
monthly billing period is acceptable only if such submission corrects an error or errors from a timely filed 
CB Adjustment for such monthly billing period.  Any other such filing made after such twentieth day is 
acceptable only if such filing is made in accordance with the special permission request provisions of 
Section 9-201(a) of the Act.

to a point adjacent to the property line of a premises upon receipt of a written request for electric service 
at such premises, subject to the provisions in Sections 410.400 and 410.410 of the 83 Illinois 
Administrative Code Part 410, as applicable.  For a situation in which an extension of the Company’s 
distribution system is necessary in order to provide standard electric service to such premises, the 
Company extends its distribution system to such premises along a street, highway or other available 
right-of-way to the nearest point adjacent to the premises upon receipt of the aforementioned written 
request for electric service at such premises.  An extension of the Company's distribution system includes 
any additional construction or investment in the Company's existing distribution system necessary to 
provide standard electric service to the premises.   
 
The entity requesting electric service at any such premises is responsible for providing the Company with 
any deposit, letter of credit, or nonrefundable payment, as applicable, computed in accordance with the 
provisions of this rider, for such extension of the Company's distribution system.   
 
For a situation in which more than one (1) extension option exists to provide electric service to more than 
one (1) premises, and the entity responsible for such premises is a group, the decision of the majority of 
the members of such group determines which option is implemented. 
 
*  EXTENSION DEPOSIT THRESHOLD. 
Generally, the Extension Deposit Threshold is equal to the Standard Extension Cost.  However, if the 
entity responsible for the premises for which the Company is required to extend its distribution facilities 
provides the Company proof of ownership or a signed lease for such premises and successfully 
completes a credit evaluation and risk screening, then the Extension Deposit Threshold is equal to the 
greater of (a) the Standard Extension Cost or (b) the Five Year Expected Delivery Revenue. 
 
EXTENSIONS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A DEPOSIT. 
*  In the event that the Company is required to extend its distribution facilities in order to provide standard 
electric service to a premises, the Company’s distribution system is extended to such premises without 
the requirement of a deposit paid to the Company provided that the estimated cost of providing such 
extension does not exceed the Extension Deposit Threshold.

*  EXTENSIONS THAT REQUIRE A DEPOSIT. 
In the event that the Company is required to extend its distribution facilities in order to provide standard 
electric service to a premises, the Company’s distribution system is extended to such premises provided 
a deposit is paid to the Company if the estimated cost of providing such extension exceeds the Extension 
Deposit Threshold. The amount of such deposit is determined in accordance with the Determination of 
Extension Cost and Deposit section of this rider.  For a situation in which an extension is provided so that 
electric service can be provided to more than one (1) premises and a deposit is required, the deposit 
amount is allocated in accordance with each premises' share of the extension or as determined by the 
group comprising the entity requesting electric service. 
 
  Deposits are refundable, with consideration given to changed circumstances or shared use of the 
extension, as applicable, for a period of ten (10) years from the date the extension is placed in service.  In 
determining refund amounts, the Company considers the incremental electric power and energy delivered 
to the premises for which the extension provides service and the revenues the Company receives from 
the application of applicable DFCs and TCs, as listed in the Delivery Service Charges Informational 
Sheets of the Company’s Schedule of Rates, with the exclusion of portions of such charges associated 
with the recovery of uncollectible costs, to such incremental electric power and energy. 
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous paragraph, for a situation in which (a) five (5), six (6), 
seven (7), eight (8), nine (9), or, but no more than, ten (10) years, respectively, have elapsed since the 
date that an extension was placed into service; (b) the average of the portion of the monthly Maximum 
Kilowatt Demands (MKDs) over the previous twelve (12) consecutive monthly billing periods established 
at the premises for the incremental electric power and energy for which such extension was provided is at 
least seventy-five percent (75%) of the originally projected kilowatt (kW) requirement associated with such 
extension; and (c) a portion of the deposit associated with such extension has not been refunded, the 
Company refunds such remaining portion.    
 
If a refund is due from a previous deposit, any further extension is made only upon the receipt of a 
deposit equal to the full estimated cost of the required additional extension. 
 
If a premises is so located that it can be served by providing a parallel, separate extension at less cost 
than the amount of a deposit required for connection to an existing extension, the entity responsible for 
such premises is not required to pay a deposit in excess of the estimated cost of the separate extension.  
Such entity does not share in any refunds applicable to the existing extension so long as the amount of 
the deposit for the separate extension remains less than the amounts of the deposits applicable to the 
existing extension. 
 
The total amount refunded never exceeds the original deposit amount for a given extension.

REGULATORY REVIEW. 
If the Company believes the cost of providing an extension is excessive, the Company may file a request 
with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) for a modification of the requirement to provide an 
extension in a specific situation. 
 
If the extension is of such cost and the electric service revenue expected to be recovered by the 
Company as a result of the provision of such extension in comparison makes it doubtful in the Company's 
reasonable judgment that such revenue would ever pay a fair compensation for the investment, 
operation, maintenance and replacement of such extension, or for other substantial reasons the 
extension is unwarranted, that information, without limitation, is reported to the ICC for investigation and 
determination as to the reasonableness of the extension. 
 
MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
*  If the premises for which an extension is required is utilized for farming and such premises includes a 
number of buildings, including but not limited to, barns and employee housing for which electric service is 
requested, the entity responsible for such premises is responsible for providing the necessary electrical 
facilities required to provide electric service to such buildings from a single point conveniently located 
near the Company’s distribution facilities.  Such point is determined by mutual agreement between the 
Company and the entity responsible for such premises.  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this 
paragraph, such buildings do not include any building occupied by a tenant that leases land or conducts a 
business separate from that of the entity responsible for the premises.

NONSTANDARD SERVICES AND FACILITIES 
 
Applicable to All Rates 
 
Standard services and facilities provided by the Company for a retail customer are determined in 
accordance with the provisions of the rate applicable to such retail customer and the General Terms and 
Conditions in the Company's Schedule of Rates. 
 
If (a) larger, more, or different services are required or requested by the retail customer, or (b) larger, 
more, or different facilities than those needed to provide standard electric service to the retail customer are 
in place, required or requested by such retail customer, and such services or facilities are reasonably and 
technically feasible, and can be furnished, installed, operated, replaced, and maintained with no significant 
adverse impact on the Company’s system with respect to reliability or efficiency, such services or facilities 
are furnished, installed, owned, operated, replaced, and maintained by the Company, provided the 
Company is allowed to recover from the retail customer the costs of furnishing, installing, owning, 
operating, replacing, and maintaining such services or facilities, including the cost consequences of any 
applicable federal or state income tax liability.  Such larger, more, or different services or facilities are 
designated in this rider as nonstandard services and facilities. 
 
If a retail customer requests or requires the removal of Company facilities, and such removal is reasonably 
and technically feasible and has no significant adverse impact on the Company’s system with respect to 
reliability or efficiency, such removal is performed by the Company provided the Company is allowed to 
recover the costs of removing such facilities from such retail customer, including the cost consequences of 
any applicable federal or state income tax liability.  Such removal is also considered to be providing 
nonstandard services and facilities. 
 
If a retail customer requests or requires temporary service or electric service on a seasonal basis, and 
such service is reasonably and technically feasible and has no significant adverse impact on the 
Company’s system with respect to reliability or efficiency, such service is provided by the Company, 
provided the Company is allowed to recover the costs of facilities required for the provision of such service 
in excess of standard facilities, and all costs associated with installing and removing facilities used to 
provide such service, from such retail customer, including the cost consequences of any applicable federal 
or state income tax liability.  Such installation, removal, and excess facilities are also considered to be 
providing nonstandard services and facilities.

The Company furnishes, installs, owns, operates, replaces, and maintains nonstandard services and facilities, 
subject to the following conditions: 
 
a.  The type, extent and location of such nonstandard services and facilities are determined by agreement 
between the Company and the retail customer and/or such retail customer's Retail Electric Supplier (RES), 
or Metering Service Provider (MSP), as applicable. 
b.  Nonstandard services and facilities are, and at all times remain, the sole property of the Company. 
c.  If the estimated cost of the nonstandard services and facilities installation exceeds the cost of a standard 
services and facilities installation by more than one hundred dollars ($100), the retail customer, RES, or 
MSP, as applicable, must pay the Company such excess amount in total prior to installation, including 
taxes, if any, except: 
1.  in the case of meter-related facilities, the retail customer, RES, or MSP, as applicable, pays monthly 
rentals in accordance with the provisions of the Rider ML - Meter-Related Facilities Lease (Rider ML); 
and 
2.  in the case of any other nonstandard services and facilities that the Company elects to provide on a 
monthly payment basis, the retail customer, RES, or MSP, as applicable, pays monthly charges equal 
to the amount by which the Company's monthly charges for the provided nonstandard services and 
facilities exceed those for standard services and facilities.  For a situation in which an additional 
nonstandard services and facilities installation is provided on a monthly payment basis, or a change in 
nonstandard services and facilities results in a different monthly payment, the monthly charges for all 
previously provided nonstandard services and facilities of the same type or category are based on the 
monthly charges in effect at the time of such installation or change. 
d.  If a portion of the nonstandard services and facilities may reasonably be used for other retail customers, the 
cost or monthly payment payable by the retail customer, RES, or MSP, as applicable, is that portion of the 
total cost or monthly payment that is reasonably assignable to such retail customer, RES, or MSP. 
e.  The late payment charge as described in the Late Payment Charges subsection of the Payment Provisions 
section of the Billing and Payment part of the General Terms and Conditions of the Company’s Schedule of 
Rates is applicable to all charges applied in accordance with the provisions of this rider. 
  f.  For a situation in which the nonstandard services and facilities are included in a qualifying project, as 
defined under the River Edge Redevelopment Zone Act (65 ILCS 115/10), either a cash payment or a letter 
of credit (LOC) may be accepted by the Company for such nonstandard services and facilities prior to 
installation.  Any such LOC that covers engineering design costs of such nonstandard services and facilities

Applicable to Rates BES, BESH, and RDS 
 
APPLICABILITY. 
This rider is applicable to a retail customer that resells or redistributes electric power and energy directly or 
through an intermediary to third persons, provided such resale or redistribution is only in a building for 
which such resale or redistribution is an uninterrupted continuation of resale or redistribution practices 
followed in accordance with previously applicable riders that were in effect from time to time since prior to 
January 2, 1957. 
 
This rider is also applicable to a retail customer for which the Company has permitted, on a continuous

Central Illinois Electric and Gas Company service territory to be served through one meter as a single 
residential retail customer. 
 
Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Applicability section, if all or substantially all of the electrical 
wiring of any such building is replaced in conjunction with interior alterations that are required by local 
code or ordinance, resale or redistribution is not permitted in the building after the conclusion of such 
alterations. 
 
If a retail customer discontinues resale or redistribution of electric power and energy in any such building, 
resale or redistribution is not subsequently permitted in such building. 
 
DEFINITIONS. 
The following definitions are for use in this rider: 
 
Building 
Building means (a) a single structure which is unified in its entirety, both physically and in operation, or 
(b) any subdivision of a single structure which subdivision is itself separately unified in its entirety, both 
physically and in operation.  In either case, a building may include separate structural sections only if 
each such separate structural section, in material part, has a contiguous surface with another 
structural section of such building.  A connection made via passageway is not considered a contiguous 
surface.  A building includes only such structure or subdivision in which electric power and energy has 
been resold or redistributed on an uninterrupted basis since the effective date of this rider. 
 
Resale 
Resale means the furnishing of electric power and energy by a retail customer to third persons in 
exchange for monetary compensation that is individually computed and separately stated by such 
retail customer for each such third person.  The electric power and energy so furnished to each such 
third person is separately metered. 
 
Redistribution 
Redistribution means the furnishing of electric power and energy by a retail customer to third persons 
under circumstances that do not constitute resale.

a third person which sets forth the terms under which the retail customer charges the third person for 
electricity.  In the absence of such written lease or other written agreement, a retail customer that resells 
electric power and energy to third persons must resell such electric power and energy at a rate that does 
not exceed the total cost that such retail customer incurs for the electric power and energy it resells.  Such 
total cost includes commodity supply charges, delivery service charges, all taxes and franchise fees and 
costs, all other costs and adders charged to the retail customer, and all other costs incurred by the retail 
customer to enable the retail customer to resell electric power and energy to third persons, including but 
not limited to, maintenance costs relating to the retail customer's internal electrical distribution system, 
fees of metering service companies, and administrative costs incurred in billing third persons for the resold 
electric power and energy.

MONTHLY CREDIT AND CHARGE (CONTINUED). 
Zero Standard Charge 
*  A Zero Standard Charge is applied to the nonresidential retail customer's bill in each monthly billing 
period.  The Zero Standard Charge is equal to the costs that the Company incurs to provide and 
maintain the distribution facilities through which the Company delivers the Zero Standard Portion to 
the nonresidential retail customer.  The Zero Standard Charge is determined and applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Company’s Rider NS - Nonstandard Services and Facilities 
(Rider NS). 
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Rider NS with respect to changes in rental charges due to 
modifications or additions to the nonstandard services and facilities, for a situation in which there are 
modifications or additions to the distribution facilities through which the Company delivers the Zero 
Standard Portion, the rental charges included in the Zero Standard Charge are changed for only such 
modified or added distribution facilities.  For other existing, unchanged distribution facilities through 
which the Company delivers the Zero Standard Portion, the associated rental charges included in the 
Zero Standard Charge remain unchanged until such time that a modification is made in such existing 
distribution facilities. 
 
MEASURMENT OF POWER AND ENERGY DELIVERED. 
For a situation in which item (1) of the Applicability section of this rider applies to the nonresidential retail 
customer, the Company determines the highest demand established by such nonresidential retail 
customer for Station Power on the basis of a sixty (60) minute period of time rather than a thirty (30) 
minute period of time.  Such determination is made by using the average of the interval demand recording 
meter's data for the two (2) thirty (30) minute intervals within each hour.  For a situation in which there are 
two (2) or more interval demand recording metering installations at such nonresidential retail customer’s 
premises, the demand established by such nonresidential retail customer in any sixty (60) minute period is 
determined by adding together the separate demands determined for each metering installation during 
such sixty (60) minute period.

PLANNING PROCESS OBLIGATIONS. 
*  Each year, by July 15 or such other date as may be required by the ICC or the IPA, the Company must 
provide a range of electric load forecasts to the IPA.  Such load forecasts must be for the five (5) year 
planning period for the next procurement plan developed in accordance with Section 16-111.5 of the Act 
and must include three (3) separate sets of hourly data. The first such set must be representative of a high 
load scenario, the second set must be representative of a low load scenario, and the third set must be 
representative of an expected load scenario.  Such load forecasts are determined for only those retail 
customers expected to be taking service under Rate BES during such five (5) year planning period.  Such 
load forecasts account for losses on the distribution system located in the Company's service territory.  
Such load forecasts also account for losses on the transmission system located in the Company's service 
territory. Along with the provision of such load forecasts, the Company must submit to the IPA the 
supporting data and assumptions it used to develop each forecast and electric load scenario. 
 
PROCUREMENT OBLIGATIONS. 
  For retail customers taking bundled electric service under Rate BES, the Company is obligated to procure 
all the component services the Company requires to meet such retail customers’ instantaneous electric 
power and energy requirements at any given time under the Company’s tariffs, applicable tariffs on file 
with the FERC, and other applicable law, including, without limitation, all required electric energy, energy 
to satisfy losses, electric generation capacity, volumetric risk management, transmission services, ancillary 
transmission services, administrative services, and other necessary services procured by the Company.  
Such obligations are met by the Company through contractual arrangements and purchases in the PJM-
administered markets or wholesale electricity markets, as applicable. 
 
IPA Contracts 
The Company must enter into binding contractual arrangements with the winning suppliers selected at 
the conclusion of a procurement event for the procurement of electric power and energy in accordance 
with a procurement plan developed pursuant to Section 16-111.5 of the Act.  Such contractual 
arrangements are herein designated as IPA Contracts.  The Company must enter into such IPA 
Contracts within three (3) business days after the ICC approves the results of such procurement 
event.  Such IPA Contracts are for the provision of ""standard wholesale products"" that, in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 16-111.5(b)(3)(iii) of the Act, may be executed ""separately or in 
combination to meet that portion of [the Company's] load requirements not met through preexisting 
contracts, including but not limited to monthly 5 x 16 peak period block energy, monthly off-peak wrap 
energy, monthly 7 x 24 energy, annual 5 x 16 energy, annual off-peak wrap energy, annual 7 x 24 
energy, monthly capacity, annual capacity, peak load capacity obligations, capacity purchase plan, 
and ancillary services."" 
 
Load Balancing 
The Company must procure electric load balancing services during the procurement period in 
accordance with the procedure for balancing load contained in the applicable procurement plan 
approved by the ICC.  In accordance with Section 16-111.5(b)(4) of the Act, such plan includes ""the 
process for (i) hourly balancing of supply and demand and (ii) the criteria for portfolio rebalancing in 
the event of significant shifts in load.""

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 16-111.5(e)(5)(i) of the Act, in the event of default by a supplier with 
which the Company entered into an IPA Contract in accordance with the provisions of the Procurement 
Obligations section of this rider, the Company reviews such contract to determine (a) the amount of 
electric power and energy such supplier was contracted to supply, and (b) the number of days remaining 
in the term of the contract.  If the result of the default is the termination of the contract, the amount of 
electric power and energy the defaulting supplier was contracted to supply is at least two hundred 
megawatts (200 MWs), and more than sixty (60) calendar days would have otherwise remained in the 
contract term, then the Company must immediately notify the IPA that a request for proposals must be 
issued for the procurement of electric power and energy to replace the electric power and energy such 
defaulting supplier was contracted to supply.  Otherwise, if the result of the default is the termination of the 
contract, then the Company procures electric power and energy to replace the electric power and energy 
such defaulting supplier was contracted to supply in PJM-administered markets.  Notwithstanding the 
provisions of the previous sentence, if any component of such replacement electric power and energy is 
not available in PJM-administered markets, the Company purchases any such component in the

included in the determination of such PEPs.  Such balance continues to be reflected in PEPs and their 
associated RPECs that are applicable through the May monthly billing period following such June monthly 
billing period. 
 
  The Company's internal administrative and operational costs solely arising from meeting the obligations 
set forth in the Procurement Obligations section of this rider are included in the PEPs. 
 
  Including costs of working capital in the PEPs provides for the recovery of costs the Company incurs for 
working capital used to arrange or procure electric power and energy supply, such as the funds required to 
finance the lag between the purchase of electric power and energy supply resources and the recovery of 
the costs of such resources from retail customers.  Such costs are determined in a manner consistent with 
a methodology used to determine costs of working capital approved by the ICC in its order in the 
Company’s most recent rate or Rate DSPP annual update case, or as otherwise provided by law, as 
applicable.  Such methodology is applied using a cost of capital equal to that established by the ICC in its 
order in such most recent case, or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable.  All other data, including 
applicable leads and lags, are updated annually to reflect current electric power and energy supply 
procurement working capital costs.  Company representatives must review such calculated costs with 
personnel from the Accounting Department of the ICC Staff in accordance with the provisions of the 
Reporting and Annual Audit section of this rider.  A cost of capital established by the ICC in its order in 
such most recent case or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable, is applied in determining the costs 
of working capital component of the PEPs only for PEPs used to determine Purchased Electricity Charges 
described in Rate BES that become applicable after the date of such order or law, as applicable.   
 
In accordance with Section 16-111.5(l) of the Act, the Company recovers ""the costs incurred by the 
[Company] in procuring a supply of electric power and energy for the applicable customer classes with no 
mark-up or return on the price paid by the [Company] for that supply."" 
 
Costs incurred by the Company to procure certain services from PJM, including but not limited to, Network 
Integration Transmission Service (NITS) and PJM-associated expenses, are not included in the 
development of the PEPs.  Instead, such costs are addressed in the PJM Services Price section of this 
rider. 
 
The aforementioned PEPs must be recomputed each time the ICC approves the results of a procurement 
event; generally procurement events are expected to occur on an annual basis and correspond to a given 
PJM Planning Year.  In addition, the PEPs must be recomputed in accordance with directives in ICC 
orders in Company rate or Rate DSPP annual update cases, or as otherwise provided by law, as 
applicable.  In addition, the PEPs may be recomputed at such times that FERC-approved or accepted 
changes in charges related to costs identified for inclusion in the PEPs become effective.

For the purpose of developing the Retail PJM Services Charge as described in the Retail PJM Services 
Charge section of this rider that allows the Company to recover the costs it incurs in procuring certain 
services from PJM, including but not limited to, NITS and other PJM-associated expenses that are not 
included in the development of the PEPs, with such costs incurred in accordance with applicable tariffs on 
file with the FERC, and other applicable law, the Company determines a PJM Services Price (PSP).  The 
PSP is equal to the expected average unit cost, in $/MWh, for all applicable PJM component services 
expected to be required for the applicable PJM Planning Year.  The PSP is developed using the electricity 
usage expected to be provided to retail customers taking service under Rate BES for a period of twelve 
(12) monthly billing periods extending from the start of a June monthly billing period and extending through 
the following May monthly billing period, corresponding to such PJM Planning Year.  Costs included in the 
determination of the PSP are calculated based on the same prices, terms, and conditions as set forth in 
applicable rates on file with the FERC.  The Company is not allowed to mark-up or include a return on 
such costs. 
 
Generally, the aforementioned PSP is expected to be determined on an annual basis.  However, the PSP 
may be recomputed at such time that the ICC approves the results of a procurement event.  In addition, 
the PSP may be recomputed at such time that FERC-approved or accepted changes in charges related to 
costs identified for inclusion in the PSP become effective. 
 
*  RETAIL PURCHASED ELECTRICITY CHARGES. 
The application of RPECs allows the Company to recover from retail customers the costs the Company 
incurs in procuring all applicable component services it is required to procure and requires to meet such 
retail customers' instantaneous electric power and energy requirements at any given time under the 
Company’s tariffs, applicable tariffs on file with the FERC, and other applicable law.  The development of 
RPECs is based upon the PEPs determined in accordance with the provisions of the Purchased Electricity 
Price section of this rider and the electricity usage characteristics of the different customer supply groups 
applicable to such retail customers to reflect each such group’s responsibility for such costs.

TERM OF SERVICE AND TERMINATION. 
The term of service hereunder is twelve (12) monthly billing periods.  A retail customer served hereunder 
must take service hereunder for the entire term of service.  In order to terminate service hereunder, the 
retail customer must provide a written termination notice to the Company at least thirty (30) calendar days 
prior to the expiration date of such term of service.  In the event that the retail customer is switching from 
service hereunder to service under Rate RDS with supply service provided by a Retail Electric Supplier 
(RES), then such RES must submit a valid DASR to the Company for such retail customer in accordance 
with the provisions of the Standard Switching subsection of the Switching Suppliers section of the 
Switching Suppliers and Switching to Bundled Service part of Rate RDS.  In the event that the retail 
customer is switching from service hereunder and Rate RDS to service under a tariff for bundled electric 
service, then the retail customer must be in compliance with all prerequisites of service for such tariff prior 
to the expiration of the term of service hereunder.  If (a) the retail customer provides no such termination 
notice, or (b) the retail customer provides a termination notice less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to 
the expiration of the term of service, or (c) any required DASR for the retail customer is not valid or timely 
submitted, or (d) the retail customer does not satisfy all prerequisites of service for the tariff to which it is 
switching, then such retail customer’s contract for service hereunder is automatically renewed for a period 
of twelve (12) monthly billing periods. 
 
*  Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous paragraph, if the Competitively Declared Customer Group 
becomes applicable to the retail customer, service hereunder terminates.  In the event of such termination, 
if the retail customer does not meet all applicable prerequisites of service under Rate RDS with supply 
service provided by a RES, then such retail customer is switched to bundled electric service under Rate 
BESH. 
 
Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Term of Service and Termination section, in the event that 
a lighting retail customer terminates service under this tariff due to the fact that such lighting retail 
customer is abandoning the lighting system for which service hereunder has been provided, the lighting 
retail customer must provide the Company with sufficient notice to enable the Company and the lighting 
retail customer to cooperatively coordinate the termination of service hereunder to coincide with the 
abandonment of such lighting system.  Otherwise, in the event that the retail customer terminates service 
from the Company under this tariff due to the fact that such retail customer is vacating its premises, 
service hereunder continues for not more than ten (10) days after the date such retail customer vacates 
the premises, provided the retail customer provides timely notice to the Company to terminate service 
hereunder at such premises. 
 
MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
For a retail customer that elects the option of having less than all its electric power and energy 
requirements supplied hereunder with such specification on a meter-by-meter basis, the electric power 
and energy for the retail customer’s load connected to the meters for which service hereunder is provided, 
must be supplied exclusively by the Company. The retail customer’s load connected to the meters for 
which service is provided hereunder must be installed, operated, and maintained in such a manner so as 
to preclude the possibility of such meters registering electric power and energy that are supplied by the 
Company under the terms of a tariff for bundled electric service or by a RES.

APPLICABILITY. 
Service under this rider is applicable to any nonresidential or lighting retail customer that (a) established a 
thirty (30) minute demand for electric power and energy greater than four hundred (400) kilowatts (kW) in 
at least one of the previous twenty-four (24) consecutive monthly billing periods and (b) received electricity 
supply service from a Retail Electric Supplier (RES) for all or a portion of its electric power and energy 
requirements during all or a portion of such previous twenty-four (24) consecutive monthly billing periods. 
 
DEFINITIONS. 
Generally, definitions of terms used in this rider are provided in the Definitions part of the General Terms 
and Conditions of the Company’s Schedule of Rates.  The following definitions are for use specifically in 
this rider: 
 
Capacity Obligation 
Capacity Obligation means the retail customer's share, in kW, of the applicable annual peak electric 
load assigned to the Company by PJM.  The Capacity Obligation for the retail customer is determined 
by the Company based on the retail customer’s peak load contribution (PLC).  The retail customer's 
PLC is determined by the Company for the period of twelve (12) consecutive monthly billing periods 
beginning with the applicable June monthly billing period and extending through the following May 
monthly billing period.  For a situation in which insufficient historical electric power and energy 
consumption data exist for a retail customer, the Company determines such retail customer's PLC 
based upon the Company's judgment and knowledge of the retail customer's electric power and 
energy requirements and contribution to such peak electric load on the PJM electric system region. 
   
NSPLC 
NSPLC means network service peak load contribution, in kW.  The retail customer's NSPLC is 
determined by the Company for the period of twelve (12) consecutive monthly billing periods beginning 
with the applicable January monthly billing period and extending through the following December 
monthly billing period.  For a situation in which insufficient historical electric power and energy 
consumption data exist for a retail customer, the Company determines such retail customer's NSPLC 
based upon the Company's judgment and knowledge of the retail customer's electric power and 
energy requirements and contribution to such peak demand for electricity on the ComEd Zone.

BILLING ADJUSTMENTS. 
The billing adjustments identified in this Billing Adjustments section are determined for a monthly billing 
period for which there are differences between (a) the quantities of electric power and energy supply that 
were (i) deemed to have been provided to the retail customer by such retail customer’s RES and (ii) used 
for the purposes of the applicable PJM wholesale market settlement, and (b) the actual quantities of 
electric power and energy supply provided to such retail customer that correspond to the quantities 
identified in item (a) in this paragraph.  Billing adjustments are determined for such monthly billing period 
only for circumstances in which (1) such monthly billing period occurred within the previous twenty-four 
(24) consecutive monthly billing periods and (2) the highest thirty (30) minute demand established by the 
retail customer exceeded 400 kW during the most recent twelve (12) consecutive monthly billing periods 
prior to such monthly billing period.  Billing adjustments are not applicable to any quantities of electric 
power and energy supply provided to the retail customer prior to the January 2013 monthly billing period. 
 
Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Billing Adjustments section, billing adjustments are not 
determined for circumstances in which such differences pertain to quantities of electric power and energy 
supply service for which the Company purchased the associated receivables in accordance with the 
provisions of Rider PORCB - Purchase of Receivables with Consolidated Billing (Rider PORCB). 
 
Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Billing Adjustments section, billing adjustments are not 
determined for circumstances in which such differences pertain to quantities of electric power and energy 
supply service or transmission service for which PJM does not make a corresponding adjustment to its 
wholesale market settlements. 
 
Hourly Energy Adjustment 
The Hourly Energy Adjustment (HEA) is equal to the summation over all applicable hours of (1) the 
HEA Factor multiplied by (2) the difference between (a) the kilowatt-hours (kWhs) that were (i) 
deemed to have been provided to the retail customer by such retail customer’s RES during the hour in 
the monthly billing period for which such HEA Factor is determined and (ii) used for the purposes of 
the applicable PJM wholesale market settlement for the time period during which such hour occurred, 
and (b) the actual kWhs provided to the retail customer during such hour that correspond to the kWhs 
identified in item (a) in this paragraph.  The value of the HEA Factor for a given hour is equal to the 
value of the Hourly Energy Charge (HEC) determined in accordance with the provisions in the Hourly 
Energy Charges subsection of the Monthly Charges section of Rate BESH – Basic Electric Service 
Hourly Pricing (Rate BESH) for such hour.

The Capacity Adjustment (CA) is equal to (1) the CA Factor multiplied by (2) the difference between 
(a) the Capacity Obligation that was (i) deemed to have been applicable to the retail customer for 
electric power and energy provided to the retail customer by such retail customer’s RES during the 
monthly billing period for which such CA Factor is determined and (ii) used for the purposes of the 
applicable PJM wholesale market settlement for the time period concluding during such monthly billing 
period, and (b) the actual Capacity Obligation applicable to the retail customer during such monthly 
billing period that corresponds to the Capacity Obligation identified in item (a) in this paragraph.  The 
value of the CA Factor for a monthly billing period is equal to the value of the Monthly Capacity Charge 
(MCC) determined in accordance with the provisions of the Capacity Charge subsection of the Monthly 
Charges section of Rate BESH for such monthly billing period.   
 
Transmission Services Adjustment 
The Transmission Services Adjustment (TSA) is equal to (1) the TSA Factor multiplied by (2) the 
difference between (a) the network service peak load contribution (NSPLC) (i) deemed to have been 
applicable to the retail customer by such retail customer’s RES during the monthly billing period for 
which such TSA Factor is determined and (ii) used for the purposes of the applicable PJM wholesale 
market settlement for the time period concluding during such monthly billing period, and (b) the actual 
NSPLC applicable to the retail customer during such monthly billing period that correspond to the 
NSPLC identified in item (a) in this paragraph.  The value of the TSA Factor for a monthly billing 
period is a dollar per kW ($/kW) value calculated based on the Company’s costs to procure certain 
services from PJM, including expenses, incurred on the basis of the annual peak demand for 
electricity on the ComEd Zone and in accordance with applicable tariffs on file with the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC), other applicable law, and Rate BESH. 
 
Miscellaneous Procurement Components Adjustment 
The Miscellaneous Procurement Components Adjustment (MPCA) is equal to (1) the MPCA Factor 
multiplied by (2) the difference between (a) the kWhs that were (i) deemed to have been provided to 
the retail customer by such retail customer’s RES during the monthly billing period for which such 
MPCA Factor is determined and (ii) used for the purposes of the applicable PJM wholesale market 
settlement for the time period concluding during such monthly billing period, and (b) the actual kWhs 
provided to the retail customer during such monthly billing period that correspond to the kWhs 
identified in item (a) in this paragraph.  The value of the MPCA Factor for a monthly billing period is a 
cents per kWh (¢/kWh) value calculated based on the Company’s costs related to the procurement of 
electric power and energy directly from PJM-administered markets in accordance with applicable 
tariffs on file with the FERC, other applicable law, and Rate BESH and which are not reflected in the 
determination of the HEA, CA, and TSA.

CS PROJECT BILLING AND REMITTANCE SERVICE.  
At such time that the Company’s systems are updated to implement the requirements of the ICC Order in 
Docket No. 21-0851, a PCSP or CS Project has the option, for a fee, to have bills issued by the Company 
to all the CS Beneficiaries or CS Subscribers with an interest in such PCSP or CS Project reflect, among 
other things, the charges associated with production of electricity by such PCSP or CS Project so that the 
Company may collect such charges from CS Beneficiaries or such CS Subscribers as provided in 
subsection 16-107.5(l) of the Act. 
 
The Company must include such charges associated with production of electricity by such PCSP or CS 
Project on the monthly bills of CS Subscribers or CS Beneficiaries, as applicable. Such line item is 
designated as the Community Supply Subscription Charge. 
 
Notwithstanding the previous provision, this CS Project Billing and Remittance Service is not available to 
any PCSP or CS Project for any CS Beneficiaries or CS Subscribers that are also taking supply service 
with a RES that is billing such CS Subscriber or CS Beneficiary under Rider SBO – Single Bill Option 
(Rider SBO).  
 
The Company does not purchase the receivables, including any uncollectible receivables, of a PCSP or 
CS Project opting to participate in this Optional CS Project Billing and Remittance Service.  
 
The Company must transfer payment made by a CS Beneficiary or CS Subscriber less the aggregate 
amount of Optional CS Project Service Charges due to the Company at such time, if any, on the next 
normally scheduled non-service account billing cycle date for such PCSP or CS Project, provided that the 
Company receives the CS Beneficiary or CS Subscriber payment before the end of the financial batch 
processing event for such PCSP’s or CS Project’s non-service bill billing group. If a CS Subscriber or CS 
Beneficiary makes a partial payment and some or all of the CS subscription or beneficiary Community 
Supply Subscription Charge remains unpaid, then the Company must notify the PCSP or CS Project by 
the first business day of the next calendar month following the payment due date.  
 
Under no circumstances is the Company obligated to collect unpaid balances, bill termination or 
cancellation fees, take credit action, or disconnect delivery service to a retail customer that owes monies 
to a PCSP or CS Project and not the Company. 
 
A PCSP or CS Project electing this CS Project Billing and Remittance Service must pay applicable fees 
as described in, and determined pursuant to, the Optional CS Project Services Charges and 
Compensation section of this rider

MINIMUM INTERCONNECTION QUEUE INFORMATION. 
The Company must electronically provide to any Developer taking service under this rider the following 
minimum interconnection queue information for all Distributed Generation or Distributed Storage 
Resource Projects, by project number and on the terms provided herein: 
 
1.  the substation where the interconnection will be made; 
 
2.  the feeder where the interconnection will be made;  
 
3.  the project’s queue position relative to other Distributed Generation or Distributed Storage Resource 
Projects proposed for interconnection to the same Company electric facilities;  
 
4.  the estimated kilowatts of potential Distributed Generation or Distributed Storage Resource Projects 
capacity or increase in Distributed Generation or Distributed Storage Resource Projects capacity on 
the feeder to which the project will interconnect; and 
 
5.  the range of costs in which the project’s estimated cost to interconnect falls.  The ranges of costs 
shall be: (a) < $500,000, (b) $500,001 - $1,000,000, (c) $1,000,001 - $2,000,000, (d) $2,000,001 - 
$5,000,000, (e) $5,000,001 - $10,000,000, and (f) > $10,000,000. 
 
The Company updates the information provided based on data that is current as of a specific point in time 
and neither that data nor the queue is represented to be, and may not be relied upon to be, current, 
complete, or accurate as of any future date.  The Company’s response to any interconnection request will 
be provided in response to a formal interconnection application, and that response may require further 
action to be taken and/or further expense to be incurred by a Developer in order to complete the 
interconnection, without regard to data obtained by the Developer hereunder.  Each substation and 
feeder where an interconnection will be made will be identified in the reported data by a unique index 
number assigned for the purpose of reporting interconnection queue information hereunder, and not by 
any geographic or operational designation or description.  The Company may satisfy its obligations under 
this rider by making the required interconnection queue information available to the public or to entities 
that include Developers through an internet website.  The Company anticipates that interconnection 
queue data will typically be updated monthly, but the Company shall update such data no less than once 
every calendar quarter.

ANNUAL UPDATES. 
The DG Rebate Adjustments determined in accordance with the provisions of this rider are subject to 
annual updates in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 16-107.6(h)(2) of the Act. 
 
Each year on or before May 1, the Company must file with the ICC an update of the spreadsheets 
provided in the Determination of the Net DG Rebate Revenue Requirement section of this rider, the 
schedules and work papers listed in such Determination of the Net DG Rebate Revenue Requirement 
section, and work papers determining the updated DG Rebate Adjustments in accordance with the 
applicable equation in the Determination of the DG Rebate Adjustments section of this rider to be 
applicable beginning with the January monthly billing period and extending through the December monthly 
billing period in the year following such filing. The Company’s filing shall be accompanied by a petition 
requesting the ICC open a proceeding to review such update and direct testimony supporting such update.     
 
The information used to update such spreadsheets, schedules and work papers must be based on final 
historical data reflected in the Company’s most recently filed FERC Fm 1 for the Reconciliation Year and 
include (a) projected costs to be incurred for DG Rebates during the Filing Year; and (b) a reconciliation of 
the Net DG Rebate Revenue Requirement in effect for the Reconciliation Year determined in accordance 
with the provisions of the Determination of the Net DG Rebate Revenue Requirement section of this rider, 
as previously approved, with modification as applicable, by the ICC, to the actual revenue requirement for 
such Reconciliation Year.   
 
The intent of the reconciliation described in the previous paragraph is to balance the Net DG Rebate 
Revenue Requirement reflected in the Company’s DG Rebate Adjustments applicable for a given year, if 
any, to the DG Rebate revenue requirement that would have been reflected in such DG Rebate 
Adjustments if the Company’s costs pertaining to DG Rebates for such year had been available at the time 
such DG Rebate Adjustments were filed.  Each reconciliation must be certified by the Company in the 
same manner that its FERC Fm 1 is certified.   
 
In accordance with Subsection 16-107.6(h) of the Act, the Company recovers all costs associated with the 
DG Rebate program regardless of whether, and to what extent, the DG Rebate program realizes or 
confers any benefits.

*  Customer Baseline Load Profile 
Customer baseline load (CBL) profile means the individual residential retail customer’s representative 
hourly electricity usage, in kilowatt-hours (kWh), during a span of time that does not occur during a 
specific Curtailment Period, but that corresponds to such specific Curtailment Period.  Such residential 
retail customer’s representative electricity usage during each hour in such span of time is determined to 
be equal to the average of such residential retail customer’s kWh usage during the corresponding hour in 
the three (3) individual weekdays during which such residential retail customer’s kWh usage for the 
hours corresponding to the specific Curtailment Period is at its highest within the fourteen (14) weekday 
period immediately prior to the date of the specific Curtailment Period.  Notwithstanding the previous 
provisions of this paragraph, (a) if one or more holidays, as designated by the North American Electric 
Reliability Corporation (NERC) and/or Curtailment Periods for which the residential retail customer 
received a notification from the Company as described in the Curtailment Period Notification section of 
this rider occurred during such fourteen (14) weekday period, then such period is increased by the 
number of days during which holidays and/or Curtailment Periods occurred, and (b) (i) if the Heat Index 
(HI) during such span of time in one or two of such three (3) individual weekdays is not within 10% of the 
HI during the hours of the specific Curtailment Period, then the kWh usage from such day or days is not 
included in such average or (ii) if the HI during such span of time in all three (3) individual weekdays is 
not within 10% of the HI during the hours of the specific Curtailment Period, then the kWh usage from the 
single individual weekday in such period during which such residential retail customer’s kWh usage for 
the hours corresponding to the specific Curtailment Period is at its highest is used. 
 
Any subsequent proposal by the Company to use a different methodology to determine CBL profiles 
must be filed by the Company in a petition with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) no later than 
the February 1 and approved, or approved as modified, by the ICC no later than the April 1 prior to the 
beginning of the PJM Planning Year during which such methodology is first used.   Modification by the 
ICC may include but is not limited to rejecting any proposed changes and maintaining the status quo.  
Any such methodology must be in accordance with a baseline load profile methodology approved by 
PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM). 
 
*  Heat Index 
Heat Index (HI) means a measure of weather that is a function of air temperature and relative humidity.  
Generally, air temperature and relative humidity measurements taken at the Chicago O’Hare 
International Airport Weather Station are utilized in the determination of HIs used to determine CBL 
profiles.  However, the Company may utilize air temperature and relative humidity measurements taken 
at other weather stations located within its service territory if such measurements provide for increased 
accuracy in the determination of CBL profiles.

Period is equal to (a) the following Peak Time Rebate (PTR) multiplied by (b) the kWh differential between (i) 
the sum of the kWhs provided to such residential retail customer during such Curtailment Period and (ii) the 
sum of the kWhs associated with the hours in the Curtailment Period in such residential retail customer’s 
CBL profile.  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Peak Time Rebate section, in the event that (1) 
the sum of the kWhs associated with the hours in the Curtailment Period in such residential retail customer’s 
CBL profile does not exceed (2) the sum of the kWhs provided to such residential retail customer during such 
Curtailment Period, then no credit is provided to such residential retail customer for such Curtailment Period.

Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Peak Time Rebate section, in the event that during a 
Curtailment Period there is an interruption in the delivery of electricity to the residential retail customer’s 
premises, the kWhs in such residential retail customer’s CBL profile associated with the span of time over 
which such interruption occurs are set to zero.  
 
*  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Peak Time Rebate section, in the event that a CBL is not able 
to be determined for a residential retail customer for a specific Curtailment Period, but one (1) or more 
credits were able to be determined for such residential retail customer for previous Curtailment Periods, then 
(a) a quotient is obtained by dividing the value of each of up to the three (3) most recently determined credits 
for such residential retail customer by the number of hours in the associated previous Curtailment Period, (b) 
the average of such up to three (3) quotients is determined, and (c) a product is obtained by multiplying such 
average by the number of hours in such specific Curtailment Period, with such product deemed to be the 
credit for such residential retail customer for such specific Curtailment Period. 
 
 *  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Peak Time Rebate section, in the event that a CBL is not able 
to be determined for a residential retail customer for a specific Curtailment Period, and no credit was

AVAILABILITY. 
This rider is available to any nonresidential retail customer (a) that commits to a minimum Load Reduction, 
as defined in the Program Provisions section of this rider, of ten kilowatts (10 kW); and (b) for which  
(1) meter-related facilities are provided that are able to measure the electric power and energy, in kilowatt-
hours (kWhs), delivered to the nonresidential retail customer and the rate, in kilowatts (kWs), at which 
such electric power and energy are delivered for each half hour in each monthly billing period, or (2) the 
Company provides a written waiver of the need for such meter-related facilities because, as determined by 
the Company, an acceptable alternative method for measuring such nonresidential retail customer's Load 
Reduction is in place and functioning properly. 
 
Service hereunder is not restricted to nonresidential retail customers that obtain electric power and energy 
supply from the Company. 
 
*  PROGRAM PROVISIONS. 
The Voluntary Load Response and System Reliability Program (VLR Program) allows the Company to 
obtain temporary reductions in the electric power and energy demands on the electric delivery system 
located in its service territory through voluntary responses by nonresidential retail customers to Company 
requests for reductions in such nonresidential retail customers' electric power and energy requirements.  
The Company reserves the right to activate the VLR Program upon notice and for any reason, including 
(a) response to shortages of available capacity on the Company’s distribution system, (b) response to 
shortages of available capacity on the transmission system located in the Company’s service territory, or 
(c) preservation of the availability of other load response resources.  A nonresidential retail customer to 
which this rider is available that elects service hereunder is defined as a participant. 
 
An activation of the VLR Program is defined as an event.  The duration of an event is not less than two (2) 
hours and generally no more than eight (8) hours.  Under certain circumstances, the Company may 
request an event to extend beyond eight (8) hours to achieve localized relief of transmission or distribution 
congestion.  Generally, the Company expects to provide notice of no less than one (1) hour prior to any 
event. 
 
The half-hourly amounts, in kW, by which a participant reduces its electric power requirements during an 
event are defined as such participant's Load Reductions.  The Company determines a participant's Load 
Reductions based upon the difference between such participant's (a) estimated normal electric load profile 
during the event, and (b) actual electric load profile during the event.  The participant's associated Energy 
Reductions, in kWh, equal (1) each such Load Reduction multiplied by (2) the time over which it occurred.  
The summation of the Energy Reductions for an event equals the participant's Total Energy Reduction, in 
kWh, for such event.

RIDER RESRRTP 
RETAIL ELECTRIC SUPPLIER RESIDENTIAL REAL TIME PRICING PROGRAM 
 
Applicable to Rate RESS 
 
AVAILABILITY. 
This rider is available to any Retail Electric Supplier (RES), as defined in the Definitions part of the 
General Terms and Conditions of the Company's Schedule of Rates, taking service under Rate RESS - 
Retail Electric Supplier Service (Rate RESS), that offers a residential real time pricing program in 
accordance with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) Order entered December 20, 2006, in 
Docket No. 06-0617 (RRTP Program) to residential retail customers taking service under Rate RDS - 
Retail Delivery Service (Rate RDS) with electric power and energy supply service provided by the RES. 
 
PREREQUISITIES FOR SERVICE. 
Before commencing service hereunder, a RES must execute a Rider RESRRTP Contract Addendum.  The 
Rider RESRRTP Contract Addendum includes a sworn statement by the RES asserting that beginning 
with the monthly billing period after the appropriate metering is installed at applicable residential retail 
customer premises, residential retail customers that so request are served by the RES under an  
RRTP Program, in which (a) pricing for electric power and energy supply service includes hourly energy 
prices that directly reflect PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) real time locational marginal prices (LMPs) 
and (b) residential retail customers taking service under the RRTP Program are required to participate in 
such program for a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive monthly billing periods. 
 
CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS. 
Pursuant to the ICC Order entered December 20, 2006, in Docket No. 06-0617, a RES taking service 
hereunder is obligated to: 
 
1.  provide advance notice to the Company for each residential retail customer that requests service 
under an RRTP Program offered by the RES, so that appropriate metering can be installed at such 
residential retail customer's premises as a prerequisite of taking service under such program as it 
would for a residential retail customer taking service under Rate BESH - Basic Electric Service Hourly 
Pricing (Rate BESH); 
 
2.  provide advance notice to the Company for each residential retail customer at such time that pricing 
for electric power and energy supply service in such residential retail customer’s contract with such 
RES changes to something other than RRTP Program pricing, so that the metering can be exchanged, 
as appropriate, as it would for a residential retail customer that has been taking service under Rate 
BESH and elects to take service under another applicable rate that requires different metering; 
 
3.  agree to submit to periodic audits conducted by the ICC Staff of such RES's contracts with residential 
retail customers participating in such RES's RRTP Program; and 
 
4.  assume financial responsibility for all charges and fees waived by the Company for any residential 
retail customer in the event it is determined that such residential retail customer is no longer 
participating in the RES’s RRTP Program. 
 
The Company must reimburse the ICC for the travel and business expenses incurred by the ICC Staff in 
conducting the periodic audits described in item (3) in this Continuing Obligations section.

(c) such RES fails to abide by the provision in the Continuing Obligations section of this rider.  Such 
termination does not relieve the RES of any obligation to make any payments to the Company for amounts 
owed to the Company by the RES. 
 
MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
The Company is not liable for any act, omission, promise, or representation of any RES that takes service 
hereunder.  The Company is not liable to any retail customer for any damages caused by any equipment

COMPANY LOGO, TRADEMARKS, AND SERVICE MARKS. 
A RES taking service under this rider is hereby licensed to reproduce on its bills to a retail customer for 
which it is providing single bills pursuant to this rider, without charge, those trademarks and service marks 
of the Company that are included in or with the billing materials submitted by the Company to the RES for 
that retail customer.  No RES thereby obtains any right, title, or interest in, or continuing right to use, any 
such mark.  This license grants specific and limited rights; all other rights are reserved. 
 
CHARGES AND CREDITS. 
*  Single Bill Option Credit 
The Company credits the retail customer for each bill the Company submits to the RES that otherwise 
would be sent by the Company to such retail customer and for which the RES provides billing of the 
Company’s delivery service under this rider.  The amount of the Single Bill Option (SBO) Credit is as 
provided in Informational Sheet No. 34.  
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Single Bill Option Credit subsection, the retail 
customer has no right to the SBO Credit during monthly billing periods in which such retail customer 
has a past due unpaid balance for tariffed bundled electric service, unless such retail customer has a 
legitimate billing dispute regarding such past due unpaid balance. 
 
Late Remittance Charge 
In the event that the RES does not remit payments as specified in the Continuing Obligations section 
of this rider as RES Continuing Obligation item (6), in the timely manner described therein, a late 
remittance charge payable in any month and accrued daily, is assessed to the RES that is equal to a 
monthly rate of 1.5% of the amount not remitted to the Company in such timely manner and any 
unpaid amounts from prior months, including previously assessed late remittance charges. 
 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SINGLE BILL OPTION. 
A RES is allowed to provide billing of the Company’s delivery service for only those of the Company’s 
retail customers for which the RES is providing electric power and energy supply services.  A RES may 
elect to provide such billing for all or some of such retail customers.  Notwithstanding the previous 
provisions of this Implementation of the Single Bill Option section, a RES is not allowed to provide billing of 
the Company’s delivery service for any retail customer for which a portion of such retail customer’s electric 
power and energy requirements is supplied by the Company.  In addition, a RES is not allowed to provide 
billing of the Company’s delivery service for any retail customer for which there is a past due unpaid 
balance for tariffed bundled electric service provided by the Company to such retail customer, unless (a) 
such retail customer has a legitimate billing dispute regarding such past due unpaid balance or (b) such 
unpaid balance is created after such RES notifies the Company of its election to provide billing of the 
Company’s delivery service for such retail customer.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SINGLE BILL OPTION (CONTINUED). 
*  The RES must notify the Company of its election of this single bill option for each of the Company’s retail 
customers for which the RES is providing billing of the Company’s delivery service by submitting a Direct 
Access Service Request (DASR) for each such retail customer which informs the Company of the RES’s 
election of this single bill option for such retail customer.  The election of this option for such retail 
customer is effective on the Company’s next normally scheduled meter reading or billing cycle date for 
such retail customer.  Such effective meter reading or billing cycle date is the beginning date of the first 
monthly billing period for which the RES provides billing of the Company’s delivery service for such retail 
customer.  Such notification may be included in the DASR submitted in accordance with the provisions in 
such Standard Switching subsection which informs the Company of the retail customer’s selection of such 
RES as the retail customer’s provider of electric power and energy supply services. 
 
In satisfying RES Continuing Obligation item (6) as specified in the Continuing Obligations section of this 
rider, the RES must make an annual selection of one of the two payment options stated therein in 
accordance with which it must remit payments due to the Company from each of the Company’s retail 
customers for which the RES is providing billing of the Company’s delivery service.  Such option, as

TERM OF CONTRACT AND TERMINATION PROVISIONS. 
For a RES first receiving service hereunder or resuming service hereunder after a previous termination 
of service hereunder, the initial term of contract between the Company and the RES is twenty-four (24) 
months.  Upon expiration of the initial or any renewal term of contract, the term of contract is automatically 
renewed for a period of twelve (12) months. 
 
*  A RES taking service hereunder has the right to terminate its Rider SBO Contract Addendum and 
discontinue service hereunder at any time on at least sixty (60) days’ written notice to the Company, 
provided, however, that in the event of such termination, all amounts due the Company are timely paid, 
and such RES is not eligible to take service hereunder for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months.  In 
such event, the RES must submit a DASR for each of the Company’s retail customers for which the RES 
had been providing billing of the Company’s delivery service that notifies the Company that service 
hereunder for each such retail customer is terminated and such retail customer is to be billed for the 
Company’s delivery service by the Company. The termination of this option for such retail customer is 
effective on the Company’s next normally scheduled meter reading or billing cycle date for such retail 
customer.  Such effective meter reading or billing cycle date is the ending date of the last monthly billing 
period for which the RES provides billing of the Company’s delivery service for such retail customer.  
 
The Company has the right to terminate its Rider SBO Contract Addendum and discontinue service to a 
RES hereunder if such RES (a) has its service under Rate RESS terminated; or (b) fails to abide by the 
provisions in the Continuing Obligations section of this rider.  Such termination does not relieve the RES of 
any obligation to make any payments to the Company for amounts owed to the Company by the RES or 
owed to the Company by the Company’s retail customers for which the RES had been providing billing of 
the Company’s delivery service. 
 
In the event of such termination, the RES agrees that the Company has the right to draw on any bond or 
letter of credit established by the RES pursuant to the Credit Requirements section of this rider for any 
amounts due to the Company.  Any actions by the Company in accordance with such right do not act to 
prevent termination as herein provided.

P  =  Payments, in dollars ($), equal to the sum of the expenditures the Company 
expects to incur or revenues the Company expects to receive associated with the 
procurement of CMCs during the months corresponding to the monthly billing 
periods during which the CFR Adjustment is applicable.  Such expenditures 
include, but are not limited to, payments that the Company must make to CFERs 
during the delivery year beginning in calendar year X in accordance with 
applicable CMC Contracts and reasonable costs the Company expects to incur 
as part of the CMC procurement processes and to implement and comply with 
plans and processes approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) to 
effectuate subsection 1-75(d-10) of the IPA Act. Such costs the Company 
expects to incur as part of the CMC procurement processes and to implement 
and comply with plans and processes approved by the ICC to effectuate 
subsection 1-75(d-10) of the IPA Act include but are not limited to costs of 
working capital used to arrange or procure CMCs, with such costs determined in 
a manner consistent with the methodology used to determine costs of working 
capital approved by the ICC in its order in the Company’s most recent rate or 
Rate DSPP – Delivery Service Pricing and Performance (Rate DSPP) annual 
update case, or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable.   
 
Including costs of working capital in the determination of the P provides for the 
recovery of costs the Company incurs for working capital used to arrange or 
procure CMCs, such as the funds required to finance the lag between the 
purchase of CMCs and the recovery of the costs of such resources from retail 
customers.  Such costs are determined in a manner consistent with the 
methodology used to determine costs of working capital approved by the ICC in 
its order in the Company’s most recent rate or Rate DSPP annual update case, 
or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable.  Such methodology is applied 
using a cost of capital equal to that established by the ICC in its order in such 
most recent case or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable.  All other data, 
including applicable leads and lags, are updated annually to reflect current CMC 
procurement working capital costs.  Company representatives must review such 
calculated costs with personnel from the Accounting Department of the ICC Staff 
in accordance with the provisions of the Annual Review and Reconciliation 
section of this rider.  A cost of capital established by the ICC in its order in such 
most recent case or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable, is applied in 
determining the costs of the working capital component of the AP, as defined in 
this Determination of the Carbon-Free Resource Adjustment section, only for 
CMCs that become applicable after the date of such order or law, as applicable.

DETERMINATION OF THE CARBON-FREE RESOURCE ADJUSTMENT (CONTINUED). 
BU  =  Balance Usage, in kWh, equal to the electricity forecasted to be delivered to retail 
customers during the monthly billing periods during which the BA is applicable. 
 
 
*  Generally, CFR Adjustments are determined in May each calendar year for application during the monthly 
billing periods corresponding to the Summer and Nonsummer Periods defined in the Definitions part of 
General Terms and Conditions of the Company’s Schedule of Rates.  The CFR Adjustment applicable 
during the monthly billing periods corresponding to the Nonsummer Period may be updated in September 
to better match the Company’s applicable expected costs and its recovery of those costs.  Updates to 
such CFR Adjustments are subsequently determined in August of such calendar year to incorporate the 
BA, as applicable.  In addition, a CFR Adjustment may be revised to incorporate a correction in an OA as 
determined by the Company or in accordance with an ICC Order issued in a proceeding as described in 
the Annual Review and Reconciliation section of this rider directing the Company to include an OA.  
Moreover, the CFR Adjustment may be revised by the Company in accordance with this Determination of 
the Carbon-Free Resource Adjustment section if the Company determines such revised CFR Adjustment 
results in a better match between the Company’s applicable expected costs and its recovery of those 
costs.   
 
APPLICATION OF THE CARBON-FREE RESOURCE ADJUSTMENT. 
The CFR Adjustment is applicable to each kWh delivered to each retail customer during the monthly 
billing period during which the CFR Adjustment is effective.  The amount resulting from such application 
of the CFR Adjustment must be shown as a separate line item on each electric service bill for each such 
retail customer, as applicable.  Such line item is designated as the Carbon-Free Energy Resource Adj.

ANNUAL REVIEW AND RECONCILIATION. 
Beginning in 2023, each year at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the start of the June monthly billing 
period, internal administrative and operational costs and costs of working capital expected to be incurred 
by the Company as a result of its CMC procurement activities for retail customers beginning on the June 
1 corresponding to such June monthly billing period must be reviewed by Company representatives with 
personnel from the Accounting Department of the ICC Staff. 
 
Beginning in 2023, in each year X the Company must conduct an audit of its costs and the recoveries 
associated with such costs for the delivery year beginning June 1 in year X-1 during which period the 
Company procured CMCs.  Such audit must be conducted within four (4) months after the end of such 
delivery year and must examine whether (a) the CFR Adjustment is properly billed to customers, (b) costs 
recovered through this rider are properly reflected in the calculation of the CFR Adjustment, (c) costs 
recovered through this rider are recorded in the appropriate accounts, (d) accounting controls are 
effectively preventing the double recovery of costs through this rider, (e) costs recovered through this 
rider are properly reflected in the annual reconciliation pursuant to this Annual Review and Reconciliation 
section, and (f) the Company’s costs of working capital associated with expenditures for electric power 
and energy supply to ensure such costs were determined in a manner consistent with the methodology 
used to determine costs of working capital approved by the ICC in its order in the then most recent rate or 
Rate DSPP annual update case, or as otherwise provided by law, as applicable, using the cost of capital 
established by the ICC in its order in such most recent case or as otherwise provided by law, as 
applicable. The Company must prepare a report that summarizes the results of such audit.  Such report 
must be submitted to the ICC in an informational filing, with copies of such report provided to the Director 
of the ICC Staff's Financial Analysis Division, and the Director of the ICC Staff's Office of Retail Market 
Development, and e-mailed to ICC.AccountingMgr@illinois.gov no later than November 1 of the calendar 
year in which such audit is conducted.  Such report must be verified by an officer of the Company.  In 
addition, the Company must file a petition with the ICC that requests the ICC initiate a CFR Adjustment 
reconciliation proceeding.  Such petition must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days after the Company 
submits to the ICC the report described in this Annual Review and Reconciliation section.  At the 
conclusion of such proceeding, the ICC determines the amount and timing of an OA, if any, to include in 
the determination of subsequent CFR Adjustments determined in accordance with the provisions of the 
Determination of the Carbon-Free Resource Adjustment section of this rider in order to correct for errors 
in CFR Adjustments applied during the June through May monthly billing periods addressed in the 
proceeding.  Any such OA is determined to the extent that any such error has not been already reflected 
in an applicable BA or OA determined by the Company.  After any such OA is determined by the ICC, the 
Company must reflect such OA in the determination of CFR Adjustments in accordance with an order 
entered by the ICC that provides the terms under which the OA is to be reflected in the determination of 
CFR Adjustments.

billings associated with electric power and energy supply provided by the Company to 
residential retail customers and other retail customers that establish demands for 
electricity that are less than 400 kW for the previous January through December monthly 
billing periods divided by (ii) the total amount of revenue associated with electric power

previous January through December monthly billing periods.  Beginning in 2014, the UF is 
computed once each year for application beginning with a June monthly billing period and 
extending through the following May monthly billing period.  Notwithstanding the previous 
provisions of this definition, beginning in 2018, during any POR Application Period, the UF 
may be revised by the Company to a value other than the UF calculated as described 
above if the Company determines such revised UF results in a better match between the 
Company’s applicable costs and its recovery of those costs.  The UF is never less than

Application Period, the Company begins to recover BSMICs and BSAOCs from retail customers in 
accordance with the provisions of the Consolidated Billing Adjustment section of Rider RCA - Retail 
Customer Assessments (Rider RCA).  Thereafter, the CRA is incorporated in the determination of the 
DREC s with the intention to allow the Company to recover its DICs, AOCs, BSMICs, and BSAOCs, and 
C
to reimburse retail customers to which previous POR Adjustments and CB Adjustments, in the form of 
charges, had been applied in accordance with the Purchase of Receivables Adjustment section, the 
Consolidated Billing Adjustment section, and related provisions of Rider RCA. 
 
Following each POR Application Period, the Company must determine the extent to which the 
incorporation of the CRA in the determination of the DREC s, and the application of any POR Adjustment 
C
and CB Adjustment, as described in Rider RCA, provided the Company with recovery of its accrued DICs, 
AOCs, BSMICs, and BSAOCs associated with such POR Application Period. 
 
In the event that the incorporation of the CRA in the determination of the DREC s did not allow the 
C
Company to recover its entire accrued DICs or AOCs attributable to such POR Application Period, then 
such unrecovered portion is recovered from retail customers in accordance with the provisions of the 
Purchase of Receivables Adjustment section of Rider RCA.

Reporting, and Reconciliation Requirements section, the ICC may initiate a docketed PORCB 
reconciliation proceeding.  At the conclusion of such proceeding, the ICC determines the amount, if any, to 
be included in an ordered reconciliation adjustment to the POR Adjustment or the CB Adjustment 
determined in accordance with the provisions in Rider RCA in order to (a) correct for errors in the POR 
Adjustment or the CB Adjustment calculated and applied for the previous POR Application Period, (b) 
correct for an improperly applied POR Adjustment or CB Adjustment during the previous POR Application 
Period, (c) allow only prudently incurred costs to be recovered, and (d) reconcile the revenue resulting 
from the application of the DREC s, POR Adjustment and CB Adjustment during the previous POR 
C
Application Period to the DICs, AOCs, BSMICs, and BSAOCs incurred during such previous POR 
Application Period.  Any such ordered reconciliation adjustment is determined to the extent that any of the 
aforementioned items (a) through (d) is not already reflected in the applicable balancing factor determined 
by the Company.  After any such ordered reconciliation adjustment is determined by the ICC, the 
Company must revise its POR Adjustment or CB Adjustment, as applicable, to reflect such ordered 
reconciliation adjustment in accordance with an order entered by the ICC that provides the terms under 
which the ordered reconciliation adjustment is to be reflected in the POR Adjustment or CB Adjustment.

IMPLEMENTATION (CONTINUED). 
A RES is not allowed to terminate the Company's purchase of receivables and consolidated billing of such 
RES's electric power and energy supply service to an individual residential retail customer and continue to 
provide electric power and energy supply service to such residential retail customer unless the RES also 
terminates the Company's purchase of receivables and consolidated billing of such RES's electric power 
 
and energy supply service for all residential retail customers served by such RES.  With respect to any 
other individual retail customer, as applicable, a RES is allowed to terminate the Company's purchase of 
receivables and consolidated billing of such RES's electric power and energy supply service to such 
individual retail customer.  In the event that a RES makes any such termination, the RES must submit 
 
notification through the submission of a DASR to the Company of such termination with respect to each 
such retail customer.  Such termination for each such retail customer is effective on the Company’s next 
normally scheduled meter reading or billing cycle date for such retail customer.  Such effective meter 
reading or billing cycle date is the ending date of the last monthly billing period for which the Company 
purchases receivables from the RES and provides consolidated billing for the amounts billed to such retail 
customer for the RES's electric power and energy supply service.  Moreover, with respect to residential 
retail customers, in the event that a RES makes such terminations, for a period of at least twelve (12) 
months following such terminations the RES may not elect to have the Company purchase receivables 
and provide consolidated billing of such RES's electric power and energy supply service provided to any 
residential retail customer. 
 
In the event that a delivery class other than one identified in the first paragraph of this Implementation 
section becomes applicable to a retail customer with respect to which the Company has been purchasing 
the RES's receivables for electric power and energy supply service, the Company terminates the purchase 
of receivables for such RES's electric power and energy supply service with respect to such retail 
customer.  In the event that a different delivery class identified in the first paragraph of this Implementation 
section becomes applicable to a retail customer with respect to which the Company has been purchasing 
the RES's receivables for electric power and energy supply service and such delivery class is applicable to 
residential retail customers, the Company terminates the purchase of receivables for such RES's electric 
power and energy supply service with respect to such retail customer unless the Company is purchasing 
the RES's receivables for electric power and energy supply service provided to all residential retail 
customers served by such RES.  The termination of the purchase of receivables with respect to a retail 
customer is effective on the Company’s next normally scheduled meter reading or billing cycle date for 
such retail customer, and such date is the ending date of the last monthly billing period for which the 
Company purchases receivables from the RES for the amounts billed to such retail customer for the RES's 
electric power and energy supply service. 
 
The Company produces and provides consolidated monthly bills for both the electric power and energy 
supply service provided by the RES and the electric delivery service provided by the Company only for 
those retail customers for which it is purchasing such RES's receivables for electric power and energy 
supply service provided to such retail customers by such RES.  In the event that such purchase of 
receivables with respect to an individual customer terminates, the Company correspondingly terminates 
the provision of billing of the electric power and energy supply service provided by the RES to such retail 
customer.

termination does not prohibit the Company from pursuing collection of amounts owed to the Company by 
the RES or owed to the Company by the Company’s retail customers with respect to which the Company 
had been purchasing the RES's receivables for electric power and energy supply service.

Where: 
 
DUREC  =  Discounted Uncollectible Receivables, in dollars ($) rounded to the cent, equal to the 
amount the Company must remit to the RES for the uncollectible receivables sold by the 
RES to the Company pertaining to the electric power and energy supply service provided 
by the RES to the retail customer. 
 
HRR  =  Historic Recovery Rate, in decimal format rounded to the ten thousandths, equal to the 
ratio of (a) the net collected amount pertaining to amounts billed for electric service that 
had been identified as uncollectible after being in arrears for at least ninety (90) days 
during the previous calendar year, with such total uncollectible amounts prior to such 
collection described herein as gross charge-offs, to (b) such gross charge-offs.   
 
UREC  =  Uncollectible Receivables, in $ rounded to the cent, equal to the amount the retail 
customer is in arrears for electric power and energy supply service provided to such retail 
customer by the RES for no more than two monthly billing periods. 
 
AC  =  Administrative Costs, in $ rounded to the cent, equal to the Company’s cost of processing 
the uncollectible receivable sold by the RES to the Company pertaining to the electric 
power and energy supply service provided by the RES to the retail customer.   
 
 
HRR and AC must be updated annually by the Company with an effective date of June 1.  Each year such 
updated HRR and AC must be submitted by the Company to the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) in 
an informational filing no later than May 15.  Any such informational filing must be accompanied by 
supporting work papers and documentation, and such supporting information must be provided to the 
Manager of Accounting of the ICC Staff.  Any informational filing of an updated HRR or AC submitted after 
May 15, but prior to its June 1 effective date, is acceptable only if such informational filing corrects an error 
or errors from a timely filed HRR or AC.  Any other such information filing made of an updated HRR or AC

DETERMINATION OF BILLING DETERMINANTS. 
As required by Section 16-108.5(c)(4)(H) of the Act, weather normalized billing determinants for the prior 
calendar year are determined in accordance with the provisions of this Determination of Billing 
Determinants section.  Such billing determinants are determined in accordance with applicable provisions 
of the 83 Illinois Administrative Code. 
 
Weather normalized billing determinants are obtained by applying adjustments to actual billing 
determinants in order to eliminate or reduce to the extent practical the impact of abnormal weather 
conditions on such billing determinants, thereby developing billing determinants that are expected to exist 
under normal weather conditions.  Such adjustments are determined by using weather adjustment 
coefficients in conjunction with deviations from normal weather.  Weather adjustment coefficients are 
obtained through the use of econometric models based on statistical multi-variant regressions, which 
provide an accepted method for determining the correlation between weather variables and electrical 
usage. 
 
A separate model is developed for each of the Company’s delivery classes, as applicable, using monthly 
data from multiple previous consecutive calendar years.  Each model is developed using the input of 
professional econometric modelers with model statistics guiding that development. 
 
Residential Sector Models 
A separate model is developed for each of the (a) Residential Single Family Without Electric Space 
Heat Delivery Class, (b) Residential Multi Family Without Electric Space Heat Delivery Class, (c) 
Residential Single Family With Electric Space Heat Delivery Class, and (d) Residential Multi Family 
With Electric Space Heat Delivery Class. 
 
For each such model, the dependent variable is the kilowatt-hour (kWh) usage per retail customer per 
day, and independent variables pertaining to weather conditions and economic conditions are used, 
as applicable.

DETERMINATION OF BILLING DETERMINANTS (CONTINUED). 
Nonresidential Sector Models 
A separate model is developed for each nonresidential delivery class, as applicable. 
 
For each such model the dependent variable is the kWh usage per retail customer per day, except 
that for the model for the Railroad Delivery Class the dependent variable is total monthly kWh usage.  
The independent variables in the models pertain to weather conditions and economic conditions, as 
applicable. 
 
Another separate model is developed for each nonresidential delivery class, as applicable, in which 
the dependent variable is monthly peak demand per retail customer.  Another separate model is 
developed for the Railroad Delivery Class in which the monthly peak demand is the dependent 
variable. The independent variables in the models pertain to weather conditions and economic 
conditions, as applicable. 
 
For a situation in which a significant correlation between weather and electricity usage for a 
nonresidential delivery class is not apparent, no corresponding model is developed for such delivery 
class and the associated billing determinants are not weather normalized.  Moreover, for a situation in 
which a significant correlation between weather and electricity demand is not apparent for a 
nonresidential delivery class, no corresponding model is developed for that delivery class and the 
associated billing determinants are not weather normalized. 
 
Lighting Sector Models 
No significant correlation between weather and electricity usage or demand is apparent for the 
Fixture-Included Lighting Delivery Class, Dusk to Dawn Lighting Delivery Class, or General Lighting 
Delivery Class, and therefore, no model is developed for any delivery class in the lighting sector and 
lighting sector billing determinants are not weather normalized.

*  DETERMINATION OF DELIVERY SERVICE CHARGES. 
The Net Revenue Requirement determined in accordance with the provisions of the Determination of the 
Annual Revenue Requirement section of this tariff, modified as applicable in accordance with Orders 
issued by the ICC as described in the Annual Updates section or Tariff Changes section of this tariff, is 
used to determine delivery service charges applicable to retail customers.   
 
For service provided beginning June 20, 2012, and extending through the December 2017 monthly billing 
period, such delivery service charges are determined using a rate design consistent with the rate design 
approved by the ICC in its Order entered May 24, 2011, in Docket No. 10-0467, as further directed by the 
ICC in its Order dated May 29, 2012, in Docket No. 11-0721 and Order dated December 18, 2013, in 
Docket No. 13-0387.  For service provided beginning with the January 2018 monthly billing period, such 
delivery service charges are determined using a rate design consistent with the rate design approved by 
the ICC in its Order dated July 26, 2017, in Docket No. 17-0049.  For service provided beginning with the 
January 2022 monthly billing period, such delivery service charges are determined using a rate design 
consistent with the rate design approved by the ICC in its Order dated May 27, 2021, in Docket No. 20-
0832. 
 
Certain data and adjustments used in such rate design methodology are updated on an annual basis.  
Along with the aforementioned Net Revenue Requirement, such updated data and adjustments include 
the following information, which are, as applicable beginning with the January 2022 monthly billing period, 
consistent with the directives issued by the ICC in its Order in Docket No. 20-0832: 
 
a)  historical billing determinants that have been weather normalized in accordance with the provisions of 
the Determination of Billing Determinants section of this tariff; 
 
b)  embedded costs from the Company’s Embedded Cost of Service Study (ECOSS) developed in 
accordance with applicable provisions of the 83 Illinois Administrative Code; 
 
c)  minor adjustments to provide for the recovery of the entire Net Revenue Requirement with no over 
recovery; 
 
d)  an adjustment to provide for the ratable reassignment of revenue responsibility to the Residential 
Sector, Lighting Sector and Nonresidential Sector, excluding the Railroad Delivery Class, that are 
attributable to but are not being assigned to the Railroad Delivery Class; 
 
e)  adjustments to maintain the level of revenue responsibility approved for the Railroad Delivery Class; 
and 
 
f)  cost allocations pertaining to the Fixture-Included Lighting Delivery Class.

  Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this Determination of Delivery Service Charges section, to the 
extent that the Net Revenue Requirement approved by the ICC in its Order in Docket No. 12-0321 is 
different from the analogous Net Revenue Requirement that would have been determined in accordance 
with Public Act 98-0015 enacted on May 22, 2013, the delivery service charges that reflect such 
previously approved Net Revenue Requirement must be revised to account for such net revenue 
requirement difference.  Such revised delivery service charges (2013 Revised Delivery Service Charges) 
must also provide for the recovery or reimbursement, as applicable, of such net revenue requirement 
difference over the time period during which such 2013 Revised Delivery Service Charges are applicable. 
 
APPLICATION OF DELIVERY SERVICE CHARGES. 
*  Delivery service charges are determined for each delivery class in accordance with the provisions of the 
Determination of Delivery Service Charges section of this tariff.  Generally, delivery service charges are 
determined for application beginning with a January monthly billing period and extending through the 
following December monthly billing period.  However, (a) the delivery service charges determined in 
accordance with the ICC’s Order in Docket No. 12-0321 are applicable beginning with the January 2013 
monthly billing period and extending through the June 2013 monthly billing period, and (b) the 2013 
Revised Delivery Service Charges are applicable beginning with the July 2013 monthly billing period and 
extending through the December 2013 monthly billing period.   
 
*  Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous paragraph, after December 31, 2022, or in the event that 
(a) the Company does not fulfill its obligations in accordance with the provisions of Section 16-108.5(b) of 
the Act; (b) the average annual increase in the amount paid by certain retail customers for electric service 
exceeds 2.5%, as presented in the report that must be filed by the Company with the ICC by July 31, 
2014, in accordance with the provisions of Section 16-108.5(g) of the Act; or (c) this tariff is otherwise 
terminated in accordance with provisions in the Act, the then currently effective delivery service charges 
remain in effect beyond the end of the otherwise scheduled December monthly billing period as 
necessary until such time that the ICC approves delivery service rates in accordance with Article IX of the 
Act.  Such then approved delivery service rates may include retroactive rate adjustment with interest, as 
applicable, to reconcile the Company’s delivery service rates charged with its actual corresponding 
delivery service costs.

period and extending through the December 2013 monthly billing period, and (b) delivery service charges 
beginning with the January 2014 monthly billing period and extending through the December 2014

ANNUAL UPDATES. 
The delivery service charges determined in accordance with the provisions of this tariff, are subject to

Each year on or before May 1, beginning in 2012, the Company must file with the ICC updates of the

updates of the schedules, appendices, and work papers listed in such Determination of the Annual 
Revenue Requirement section, and updated work papers determining the updated delivery service 
charges in accordance with the provisions in the Determination of the Delivery Service Charges section of 
this tariff.   
 
The information used to update such spreadsheets, schedules, appendices, and work papers must be 
based on final historical data reflected in the Company’s most recently filed FERC Fm 1 for the prior year 
and include (a) projected plant additions and correspondingly updated depreciation reserve and expenses 
for the calendar year in which such filing is made; (b) a reconciliation of the Net Revenue Requirement in 
effect for the prior year determined in accordance with the provisions of the Determination of the Annual 
Revenue Requirement section of this tariff, as previously approved, with modification as applicable, by 
the ICC, to the actual revenue requirement for such prior year as reflected in the FERC Fm 1 for such 
prior year; and (c) relevant and necessary data and documentation that is consistent with the ICC’s rules 
applicable to a filing of a request for a general increase in delivery service rates and rules adopted by the 
ICC to implement Section 16-108.5 of the Act.  Such information is not required to be normalized.  
Notwithstanding the provisions in item (b) in this paragraph, for the update filed in 2012, the reconciliation 
must be performed in accordance with the provisions of Section 16-108.5(d)(1) of the Act. 
 
The intent of the reconciliation described in the previous paragraph is to balance the Net Revenue 
Requirement reflected in the Company’s delivery service charges for a given year to the revenue 
requirement that would have been reflected in such delivery service charges if the Company’s delivery 
service costs for such year had been available at the time such delivery service charges were filed.  Each 
reconciliation must be certified by the Company in the same manner that its FERC Fm 1 is certified.

investigation of [this tariff], provided that any such changes shall be consistent with paragraphs (1) 
through (6) of this subsection (c).” 
 
This tariff is subject to revenue neutral revisions by Orders of the ICC in accordance with the provisions of 
subsection 16-108.5(e) of the Act.  In accordance with such subsection 16-108.5(e), “Following approval 
of [this tariff] pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, the [Company] shall make a filing with the [ICC] 
within one year after the effective date of [this] tariff that proposes changes to the tariff to incorporate the 
findings of any final rate design orders of the [ICC] applicable to the [Company] and entered subsequent 
to the [ICC’s] approval of [this] tariff.  The [ICC] shall, after notice and hearing, enter its order approving, 
or approving with modification, the proposed changes to [this] tariff within 240 days after the [Company’s] 
filing.  Following such approval, the [Company] shall make a filing with the [ICC] during each subsequent 
3-year period that either proposes revenue neutral tariff changes or re-files the existing [tariff] without 
change, which shall present the [ICC] with an opportunity to suspend the [tariff] and consider revenue-
neutral tariff changes related to rate design.”   
 
Any revision ordered by the ICC in accordance with the provisions of this Tariff Changes section must 
begin to be reflected, as appropriate, in delivery service charges applicable for the first January monthly 
billing period through December monthly billing period that begins no earlier than thirty (30) calendar days 
after the ICC issues an Order adopting such revision.

DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT REFUND 
 
  Applicable to Rates BES, BESH, RDS and Pilot Rates 
 
APPLICABILITY. 
This rider is applicable to all retail customers. 
 
PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this rider is to refund the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC)-jurisdictional refund 
amount of $31,296,338 to retail customers (DPA Refund Amount) in accordance with the ICC Order 
dated August 17, 2022, in Docket Nos. 21-0607/21-0739 (Cons.).   
 
DPA REFUNDS. 
April 2023 Refund 
The Company must apply a dollar ($) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) refund amount on each retail 
customer’s April 2023 monthly electric service bill that is equal to (a) the April 2023 DPA Refund 
Credit shown in the Deferred Prosecution Agreement Refund Credit Informational Sheet of the 
Company’s Schedule of Rates designated for the delivery class applicable to such retail customer for 
the April 2023 monthly billing period multiplied by (b) the number of billing kWhs on the April 2023 
monthly bill.  The April 2023 DPA Refund Credit is determined by allocating the DPA Refund Amount 
by the corresponding revenue requirements applicable to delivery classes, as applicable, from 2011 
through 2019, and dividing by the forecasted kWhs for the April 2023 monthly billing period.  Such 
refund must be shown as a separate line item and will be designated as the Deferred Prosecution 
Agreement in the Taxes, Fees and Other section of the bill. 
 
April 2023 Residual Amount 
After July 1, 2023, the Company must determine an amount, herein identified as the April 2023 
Residual Amount.  The April 2023 Residual Amount is equal to the DPA Refund Amount less the total 
amount refunded on retail customers’ April 2023 monthly bills.  In the event that the April 2023 
Residual Amount is at least $200,000, an under-refund, then the Company must provide a refund to 
retail customers on their October 2023 monthly electric service bills.  Such refund will also be 
designated as the Deferred Prosecution Agreement on retail customer bills.  If the April 2023 
Residual Amount is less than $200,000 but greater than $0, the amount will be provided to low- and 
moderate-income residential customers in furtherance of providing financial assistance related to 
electric utility bills.  If the April 2023 Residual Amount is less than $0, an over-refund, the April 2023 
Residual Amount will be included in Schedule FR A-4: Reconciliation Computation, as provided in the 
Determination of the Delivery Reconciliation Amount section of Rider DSPR – Delivery Service 
Pricing Reconciliation (Rider DSPR), filed in the calendar year 2024.

If applicable, the Company will determine the October 2023 Residual Amount from the application of 
the October 2023 DPA Refund Credit amounts using the same methodology used for the April 2023

assistance related to electric utility bills.  If the October 2023 Residual Amount is less than $0, an 
over-refund, the October 2023 Residual Amount will be included in Schedule FR A-4: Reconciliation

INFORMATIONAL FILINGS. 
  The DPA Refund Credits determined in accordance with the provisions of this rider must be submitted by 
the Company to the ICC in an informational filing.  The Informational Sheet filing must be accompanied by

amounts by delivery class by September 20, 2023.   
 
Moreover, the Company must provide an informational filing in Docket Nos. 21-0607/21-0739 (Cons.) 
related to refund progress until both the ICC-jurisdictional and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(FERC)-jurisdictional refunds, if directed, have been completed.  In each such informational filing, the 
Company must inform the ICC how it will effectuate the FERC-jurisdictional refund, once established, with 
a copy of relevant documents.  The first such filing is due 90-days after the date of the ICC’s order dated 
August 17, 2022, or November 15, 2022, and each subsequent update within 90-days thereafter. 
 
In the event that FERC does not adopt the Company’s FERC-jurisdictional refund amount, $5,019,312 
plus the appropriate interest, the Company will donate the amount to the Low Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  In the event that the Company is unable to make such a donation to 
LIHEAP, the Company will make a filing in this docket explaining why it could not donate to LIHEAP and 
proposing another program which assists low- and moderate-income customers in paying electric utility 
bills to receive the funds.

This rider is applicable to all retail customers. 
 
PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this rider is to reconcile the Company’s delivery service rates charged and determined 
under the provisions of Section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act (Act) with its actual corresponding 
delivery service costs incurred during the final years in which formula rates determined pursuant to Section

DEFINITIONS (CONTINUED). 
Effective Period 
Effective Period means the period during which the Delivery Reconciliation Adjustment Factor (DRAF), 
the recovery mechanism for reconciliation adjustment amounts, is applicable. The Effective Period 
begins with the first January monthly billing period after the DRAF is filed and continues through the 
following December monthly billing period. 
 
FERC Fm 1 
FERC Fm 1 means the Company’s Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Financial Report 
FERC Form No. 1: Annual Report of Major Electric Utilities, Licensees and Others, or its successor. 
 
Fm 21 ILCC 
Fm 21 ILCC means the Company’s Annual Report of Electric Utilities Licensees and/or Natural Gas 
Utilities to the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC). 
 
DETERMINATION OF THE DELIVERY RECONCILIATION AMOUNT. 
The Delivery Reconciliation Amount (DRA) for an applicable Delivery Reconciliation Year shall be 
determined in accordance with the provisions of this tariff and Section 16-108.5(d) of the Act that were 
effective during the time the Company was eligible to annually update its performance based rate, which 
are consistent with the provisions of Rate DSPP, the tariff used to determine delivery service costs and 
charges during the Delivery Reconciliation Year. The DRA shall be calculated using the process outlined 
in Schedule (Sch) FR A-4. The Sch FR A-4 process generally involves (a) determining the reconciliation 
revenue requirement for the applicable Delivery Reconciliation Year as provided for in the Annual 
Reconciliation Computation section of this tariff, and (b) subtracting the revenue requirement in effect and 
used to establish delivery service charges (which includes a prior period reconciliation amount) during the 
applicable Delivery Reconciliation Year from item (a). The resulting value is the “Variance Before Collar”. 
Next, (c) the ROE collar adjustment is determined as described in the ROE Collar Computation section, 
and (d) the “Variance Before Collar” is added to the ROE Collar Adjustment.  The sum of (c) and (d) is the 
“Variance with Collar”.  Interest is next added to the “Variance with Collar” amount, which determines the 
Delivery Reconciliation Amount for the applicable Delivery Reconciliation Year. 
 
In a Delivery Reconciliation Year that ends with the effective date of delivery service tariffs approved in 
accordance with Article IX or Section 16-108.18 of the Act, the Variance Before Collar and ROE Collar 
Adjustment shall be prorated based upon the number of days in the Delivery Reconciliation Year prior to 
computing interest.

DETERMINATION OF THE DELIVERY RECONCILIATION ADJUSTMENT FACTOR. 
The Delivery Reconciliation Adjustment Factor (DRAF) for each applicable Delivery Reconciliation Year 
shall be billed over the Effective Period.  The DRAF shall be expressed as a uniform percentage carried to 
four decimal places and applied to Base Delivery Service Charges of each retail customer’s bill.  The 
DRAF is determined in accordance with the following equation: 
 
𝐷𝑅𝐴 𝑃𝑅𝐴 100%
DRAF = [( )+ (  )]×100×( ) 
𝑃𝐵𝑅 𝑃𝐵𝑅 1
𝑅
 
Where: 
DRAF  =  Delivery Reconciliation Adjustment Factor applicable to Base Delivery Service 
Charges. 
 
DRA  =  Delivery Reconciliation Amount, in $, calculated in the Determination of Delivery 
Reconciliation Amount section of this tariff. 
 
PRA  =  Prior Reconciliation Adjustment, in $, represents differences between the approved 
DRA and actual collections for the prior period 
 
PBR  =  Projected Base Rate Revenue for the twelve (12) consecutive monthly billing periods 
of the Effective Period.  Notwithstanding the above, fewer than twelve consecutive 
monthly billing periods may be used if Article IX or Section 16-108.18 rates are not yet 
approved by the first January monthly billing period after the DRAF is filed. 
 
PBR   =  The projected Base Rate Revenues for the nine (9) consecutive monthly billing 
R
periods beginning April and continuing through December. 
 
If the Company determines during the Effective Period that it is appropriate to revise the DRAF to better 
match the DRA or PRA, the Company may, from time to time, calculate a revised DRAF to become 
effective as of the beginning of any monthly billing period during the Effective Period.  Any such revision 
must be submitted by the Company to the ICC in an informational filing no later than the twentieth day of 
the month prior to the monthly billing period during which any such revised DRAF becomes applicable. 
 
Notwithstanding the above, during the Effective Period in which the PRA associated with the subsequent 
Delivery Reconciliation Year is applied to customer bills, the Company may set a DRAF at a factor that is 
not applied uniformly across all Base Delivery Service Charges or as a fixed adjustment to one or more 
charges if the Company determines the outstanding balance of the PRA can be recovered more 
accurately during a DRAF update.

INFORMATIONAL FILINGS. 
DRAF determined in accordance with the provisions of this rider must be submitted by the Company to the 
ICC in an informational filing.  The Informational Sheet filing must be accompanied by supporting work 
papers and documentation supporting their determination, as applicable. 
 
For the DRAF scheduled to be applicable beginning with a January monthly billing period and extending 
through the following December monthly billing period, the Company must file such DRAF with the ICC for 
informational purposes at least two (2) business days, and up to the number of days allocated by the ICC 
Order, after the ICC issues its Order pertaining to such updates to such DRAF as described in the Annual 
Updates section of this tariff.  In the event that the ICC does not initiate a proceeding to review the 
Company’s annual update filing described in such Annual Updates section, the Company must file such 
DRAF with the ICC for informational purposes on or before December 20 in the year prior to the January 
monthly billing period in which such DRAF is to become applicable. 
 
Any informational filing of the DRAF made after the applicable filing date previously specified in this 
Informational Filings section but prior to the date when such DRAF is scheduled to become effective is 
acceptable only if such filing corrects an error or errors from timely filed annual updates.  Any other such 
filing made after such specified date is acceptable only if such filing is made in accordance with the special 
permission request provisions of Section 9-201(a) of the Act. 
 
Moreover, subsequent to application of the first DRAF, the Company must file on or before March 20, to 
be effective with the April Billing Period, a reconciliation of differences between the approved DRA and 
actual collections for the prior fiscal year.  Such adjustments must continue until the Prior Reconciliation 
Adjustment associated with the subsequent Delivery Reconciliation Year has been applied to customer 
bills for the applicable Effective Period.

ANNUAL UPDATES. 
Following each Delivery Reconciliation Year, on or before May 1, the Company must file with the ICC 
updates of the spreadsheets provided in the Determination of the Delivery Reconciliation Amount section 
of this tariff, and updates of the schedules, appendices, and work papers listed in such Determination of 
the Delivery Reconciliation Amount section.  The information used to update such spreadsheets, 
schedules, appendices, and work papers must be based on final historical data reflected in the Company’s 
most recently filed FERC Fm 1 for the Delivery Reconciliation Year and include relevant and necessary 
data and documentation, including relevant Part 285 and 286 schedules that are consistent with the ICC’s 
rules applicable to a filing of a request for a general increase in delivery service rates and rules adopted by 
the ICC to implement Section 16-108.5 of the Act.  Part 285 Subpart H: Rate and Tariff Schedules shall 
not be required.  Such information is not required to be normalized. 
 
The reconciliation filing will also include a calculation showing the determination of the illustrative DRAF 
and associated workpapers. 
 
The intent of the reconciliation described in the previous paragraph is to balance the Net Revenue 
Requirement reflected in the Company’s delivery service charges for a given year to the revenue 
requirement that would have been reflected in such delivery service charges if the Company’s delivery 
service costs for such year had been available at the time such delivery service charges were filed.  Each 
reconciliation must be certified by the Company in the same manner that its FERC Fm 1 is certified. 
 
Within forty-five (45) calendar days after the Company files its update with the Commission as described 
previously in this Annual Updates section, the ICC has the authority to initiate a proceeding, either on its 
own initiative or upon complaint, to review the prudence and reasonableness of the delivery service costs 
to be recovered through the application of the Company’s proposed Delivery Reconciliation Adjustment 
Factor.  Such proceeding must be conducted in accordance with Section 16-108.5(d) of the Act that was 
effective during the time the Company was eligible to annually update its performance based rate.  The 
Order in such proceeding must be entered no later than two hundred, forty (240) calendar days after the 
date of the Company’s filing.  In the event that the ICC does not initiate such proceeding within such forty-
five (45) calendar days, then the updated costs and information filed by the Company as described in this 
Annual Updates section are deemed prudent and reasonable.  Updated costs and information determined 
by an Order of the ICC or deemed to be prudent and reasonable are not subject to reopening, 
reexamination, or collateral attack in any other proceeding, case, docket, rule, or regulation. 
 
MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
Nothing in this tariff is intended to allow costs that are not otherwise recoverable to be recovered simply by 
virtue of being included in the FERC Fm 1 in any given year.   
 
This tariff is inoperative if the Company has not initiated a proceeding to establish new rates under Article 
IX or Section 16-108.18 of the Act by March 31 in the year following the last year in which a formula rate 
annual update filing was permitted under Section 16-108.5 of the Act. 
 
The Company’s Schedule of Rates, of which this rider is a part, includes General Terms and Conditions 
and other tariffs.  Service hereunder is subject to the General Terms and Conditions and such other tariffs, 
as applicable.
