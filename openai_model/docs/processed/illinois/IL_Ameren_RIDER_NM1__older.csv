*  Methodology A:    
 
*  1.  Customer receiving power and energy under non Time of Use Rates: 
 
If the amount of electricity used by the Customer during the Billing Period 
exceeds the amount of electricity produced by the Customer's Private 
Generation Facility, or the Customer's share of electricity produced by an 
Eligible Facility, the EP shall calculate energy charges based on the net amount 
of electricity purchased by the Customer multiplied by the tariffed or contract 
rate, as applicable.  In addition, the Company shall charge the Customer for 
delivery and other services provided at the applicable tariffed rate.  The 
delivery service charge shall be based on the net amount of electricity used by 
the Customer. 
 
*  If the amount of electricity produced by a Customer's Private Generation 
Facility, or the Customer's share of electricity produced by an Eligible Facility, 
during the Billing Period exceeds the amount of electricity used by the 
Customer during the Billing Period, the Customer shall receive a kilowatt-hour 
credit from the EP equal to the net amount of electricity supplied by the 
Customer during the Billing Period.  The Customer shall receive a Delivery 
Service credit from the Company equal to the net amount of electricity 
supplied.  The EP and/or Company shall carry over any excess kilowatt-hour 
and Delivery Service credits earned and apply those credits to subsequent 
billing periods to offset any Customer consumption in those Billing Periods 
until all credits are used or until the end of the Annual Period.  Unused credits 
will expire at the end of the Customer’s Annual Period or when the Customer 
terminates service from the EP, as applicable.  In addition, the Company shall 
charge the Customer for other services provided at the applicable tariffed rate 
as appropriate. 
 
2.  Customer receiving power and energy under Time of Use Rates: 
 
For each applicable discrete time period, the EP shall multiply the amount of 
net electricity purchased or supplied by the Customer times the tariffed or 
contract rate for electricity supply as appropriate.  The calculated amounts 
shall be summed to determine the Customer’s net energy charge or credit for

*  The Company shall charge the Customer for delivery and other services, other 
than electric power and energy, provided at the applicable tariffed rate based 
on the Gross Amount of Electricity purchased by the Customer, as appropriate. 
 
*  For each applicable discrete time period where electricity used by Customer 
exceeds the amount of electricity produced by the Customer's Private 
Generation Facility or the Customer's share of the electricity produced by an 
Eligible Facility, the EP shall multiply the amount of net electricity purchased 
by the Customer times the tariffed or contract rate for electricity supply as 
appropriate. 
 
*  If the amount of electricity produced by a Customer's Private Generation 
Facility or the Customer's share of a electricity produced by an Eligible Facility 
during the time of use period exceeds the amount of electricity used by the 
Customer during the time of use period, the net kilowatt-hours produced shall 
be valued at the same price per kilowatt-hour as the electric service provider 
would charge for retail kilowatt-hour sales during that same time of use period. 
The calculated amounts shall be summed to determine the Customer’s net 
energy charge or credit for the Billing Period.  The Customer’s EP shall charge 
or credit the Customer for net energy as applicable. 
 
*  The EP and/or Company shall carry over any excess credits earned and apply 
those credits to subsequent billing periods to offset any Customer consumption 
in those Billing Periods until all credits are used or until the end of the Annual 
Period.  Unused credits will expire at the end of the Customer’s Annual Period 
or when the Customer terminates service from the EP, as applicable.

RES Provided Net Metering 
  For a Customer taking electric power and energy supply service from a Retail Electric

  A Customer must have metering equipment that can measure the flow of energy in both

appropriate metering.  The EP shall be responsible for the cost of installing such 
equipment for a Customer receiving service under Rate DS-1 or DS-2. 
 
  For a Customer receiving service under Rate DS-3, DS-4 or DS-6 and whose generator 
nameplate capacity is equal to or less than 2,000 kW, the generation facility must be 
separately metered with equipment that can measure the flow of energy in both directions 
at the same rate.  The cost of installing such equipment shall be paid for by the Customer. 
 
Any subsequent metering change necessitated by Customer shall be paid for by the 
Customer.

that may be required by the Company, State or Federal regulatory bodies and the 
applicable RTO in accordance with the Transmission Provider's FERC-approved tariffs 
related to Transmission Service and any other applicable tariffs.
