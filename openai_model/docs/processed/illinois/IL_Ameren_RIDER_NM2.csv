  Methodology A:    
 
  1.  Customer receiving power and energy under non Time of Use Rates: 
 
If the amount of electricity used by the Customer during the Billing Period 
exceeds the amount of electricity produced by the Customer's Private 
Generation Facility, the Company shall calculate energy charges based on the 
net amount of electricity purchased by the Customer multiplied by the tariffed 
or contract rate, as applicable.  In addition, the Company shall charge the 
Customer for delivery and other services provided at the applicable tariffed 
rate.  The delivery service charge shall be based on the net amount of 
electricity used by the Customer. 
 
If the amount of electricity produced by a Customer's Private Generation 
Facility, during the Billing Period exceeds the amount of electricity used by 
the Customer during the Billing Period, the Customer shall receive a kilowatt-
hour credit from the Company equal to the net amount of electricity supplied 
by the Customer during the Billing Period.  The Customer shall receive a 
Delivery Service credit from the Company equal to the net amount of 
electricity supplied.  The Company shall carry over any excess kilowatt-hour 
and Delivery Service credits earned and apply those credits to subsequent 
billing periods to offset any Customer consumption in those Billing Periods 
until all credits are used or until the end of the Annual Period.  Unused credits 
will expire at the end of the Customer’s Annual Period or when the Customer 
terminates service from the EP, as applicable.  In addition, the Company shall 
charge the Customer for other services provided at the applicable tariffed rate 
as appropriate. 
 
2.  Customer receiving power and energy under Time of Use Rates: 
 
For each applicable discrete time period, the Company shall multiply the 
amount of net electricity purchased or supplied by the Customer times the 
tariffed or contract rate for electricity supply as appropriate.  The calculated 
amounts shall be summed to determine the Customer’s net energy charge or 
credit for the Billing Period.  The Company shall charge or credit the 
Customer for net energy as applicable.

2.  Customer receiving power and energy under Time of Use Rates: 
 
  For each applicable discrete time period where electricity used by Customer 
exceeds the amount of electricity produced by the Customer's Private 
Generation Facility, the Company shall multiply the amount of net electricity 
purchased by the Customer times the tariffed or contract rate for electricity 
supply as appropriate. 
 
  If the amount of electricity produced by a Customer's Private Generation 
Facility, during the time of use period exceeds the amount of electricity used 
by the Customer during the time of use period, the net kilowatt hours 
produced shall be valued at the same price per kilowatt hour as the Company 
would charge for retail kilowatt hour sales during that same time of use 
period.  The calculated amounts shall be summed to determine the Customer’s 
net energy charge or credit for the Billing Period.  The Company shall charge 
or credit the Customer for net energy as applicable. 
 
The Company shall charge the Customer for delivery and other services, other than 
electric power and energy, provided at the applicable tariffed rate based on the Gross 
Amount of Electricity purchased by the Customer, as appropriate.  If Customer receives a

If the amount of electricity produced by a Customer's Private Generation 
Facility during the time of use period exceeds the amount of electricity used 
by the Customer during the time of use period, the net kilowatt-hours 
produced shall be valued at the same price per kilowatt-hour as the electric 
service provider would charge for retail kilowatt-hour sales during that same 
time of use period. The calculated amounts shall be summed to determine the 
Customer’s net energy charge or credit for the Billing Period.  The Company 
shall charge or credit the Customer for net energy and transmission charges as 
applicable. 
 
  The Company shall carry over any excess credits earned and apply those 
credits to subsequent billing periods to offset any Customer consumption in 
those Billing Periods until all credits are used. 
 
  If the Customer is a Subscriber, the Company will provide monetary credits at 
the Company's Total Price to Compare equal to the subscribers share of the 
production of the electricity from the CRGP or LICS.

  1.  Customer receiving power and energy under non Time of Use Rates: 
 
  If the Customer is a Subscriber, the Company shall provide monetary credits 
to a Subscribers subsequent bill for the Subscriber's share of the production of 
electricity from the applicable generation facility. The value of the credit shall 
be at the applicable EP’s tariffed or contract rate. Capacity and transmission 
charges not provided on a kilowatt-hour basis will be converted to a kilowatt-
hour equivalent.  For Company supplied customers, such conversion is equal 
to the dollar amount billed to the customer for capacity and transmission, 
divided by total kWh delivered to the Customer. The resulting $/kWh value 
shall be used to determine capacity and transmission credits.
