DEMAND DETERMINATION FOR BILLING 
Demand shall be as shown or computed from the readings of Company's demand meter during the fifteen minute 
period of customer's greatest use during the month.  Demand values used for billing will be rounded to the nearest 
tenth of a kW. 
 
Where no demand meters are installed, a customer's demand will be calculated for the period June 1st thru 
September 30th, inclusive.  This demand will be estimated by dividing the kWh use by 150. 
 
Where demand is expected to exceed 100 kilowatts, the Company may measure reactive demand as the greatest 
rate of reactive volt-ampere hour use during a fifteen (15) minute interval during the month. 
 
Reactive demand values used for billing will be rounded to the nearest tenth of a kvar. 
 
The provisions of this paragraph are not available to new service locations connected on or after January 1, 1983.  
Where a customer has permanently installed electrical space heating equipment of less than the total of all other 
connected load and where such electrical heating equipment represents the sole source of space and comfort 
heating, such equipment may be so connected as to exclude its contribution to measured demand. 
 
ENERGY DETERMINATION FOR BILLING 
Energy values used for billing will be rounded to the nearest hundredth of a kWh. 
 
TERM OF CONTRACT 
Customer may elect to have service discontinued at any time after giving due notice to the Company of his intention 
to do so, provided that all requirements and obligations under the tariff of the Company have been met.

A customer with fixed attached loads may request to receive service on a computed kilowatt-hour basis.  The 
Company, in its sole discretion, shall decide whether to grant such request.  Such customers shall agree to pay a 
monthly bill equivalent to the computed kilowatt-hour usage for the billing period, said usage to be determined 
mutually by the Company and customer and specified in the contract.  No changes in attached load may be made 
by the customer without the written permission of the Company and customer shall allow the Company access to its

AVAILABILITY 
This rider is available to customers having other sources of electrical energy supply, but who desire to purchase 
Standby Service from the Company.  The terms of this rider shall not be available in any month when the 
customer's Generation Availability for the current and preceding five (5) months does not exceed 50%. 
 
DEFINITIONS 
 
Standby Service: 
Standby Service is defined as the additional electrical capacity available to a customer in the event of a forced 
outage and during a mutually agreed upon customer's scheduled maintenance shutdown of the customer owned 
electrical energy source. 
 
Standby Service Capacity: 
The Standby Service Capacity shall be the maximum electrical capacity in kW supplied by the customer owned 
electrical energy source during the current and preceding five (5) months.  Such Standby Service Capacity may be 
revised with the Company’s approval as changes in the customer's load conditions warrant. 
 
Generation Availability: 
Generation Availability is defined as the availability of the customer owned electrical energy source during the 
current and preceding five (5) months and shall be determined by dividing the Kwhrs produced during this period by 
the product of the Standby Service Capacity times 4380 hours. 
 
MODIFICATION OF DEMAND DETERMINATION 
The monthly billing demand shall be as defined under the ""Demand Determination"" section of the applicable rate 
schedule. 
 
The Standby Service Demand shall be the ""Standby Service Capacity"" as defined above. 
 
During the billing months in which a forced outage or mutually agreed upon customer's scheduled maintenance 
shutdown occurs, the billing demand will be determined by subtracting the Standby Service Capacity from the total 
demand and waives the minimum charge provision of the applicable rate schedule.  Electric service is provided 
under the terms of the applicable rate schedule.  Total demand is defined as the sum of the Company's demand 
meter plus demand supplied by the other sources of electrical energy, all computed to the nearest whole kilowatt 
during a fifteen minute period.

TERM OF CONTRACT 
The contract term shall be same as that under the customer’s applicable Rate Schedule.  
 
MONTHLY RATES, RATE COMPONENTS AND BILLING UNIT PROVISIONS 
The monthly rates, rate components and billing unit provisions shall be those as stated under the customer’s 
applicable Rate Schedule.  Under this Rider, only the per kilowatt-hour charge components of the customer’s bill are 
affected.  The monthly charges shall be based on one of the following conditions:  
 
a)  When the monthly energy meter reading registers that the customer has consumed more energy than the 
customer delivered to the Company’s delivery system by the end of the monthly billing period, the customer shall 
be charged for the net amount of electricity consumed based on the rates and charges under the customer’s 
applicable Rate Schedule for either Delivery Service when the customer has a third party supplier as its electric 
supplier, or the combined Delivery, Transmission and Basic Generation Service when the customer has the 
Company as its electric supplier; or 
b)  If the customer is receiving combined Delivery, Transmission and Basic Generation Service, and the monthly 
energy meter reading registers that the customer has delivered more energy to the Company’s delivery system 
than the customer has consumed by the end of the monthly billing period, the customer shall be charged the 
Customer Charge and any appropriate demand charges based on the customer’s applicable Rate Schedule.  In 
addition, the Company shall receive and take ownership of the delivered energy from the customer and the 
Company shall credit the customer for that delivered energy.  At the end of twelve consecutive monthly billing 
periods beginning with the first month in which net metering becomes applicable (annualized period), the 
customer will be compensated for any remaining credits at the average Residual Metered Load Aggregate 
locational marginal price for energy, for the annualized period, in the Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland 
Interconnection (PJM) Control Area Transmission Zone for the Company.  In the event that a customer leaves 
Basic Generation Service prior to the end of the annualized period, the end of the service period will be treated 
as if it were the end of the annualized period; or 
c)  If the customer has a third party supplier and the monthly energy meter reading registers that the customer has 
delivered more energy to the Company’s delivery system than the customer has consumed by the end of the 
monthly billing period, the customer shall be charged the Customer Charge and any appropriate demand charges 
based on the customer’s applicable Rate Schedule. Monthly meter data will be forwarded to the customer’s third 
party supplier in accordance with existing Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Standards.  In the event that a 
customer changes electric supplier prior to the end of the annualized period, the end of the service period will be 
treated as if it were the end of the annualized period. 
The customer has one opportunity to select an annualized billing period in accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C. 
14:8-4.3. 
 
RENEWABLE ENERGY CERTIFICATES 
The Renewable Energy Certificates generated by the customer-generator facility are owned entirely by the customer

b)  If the customer is receiving combined Delivery, Transmission and Basic Generation Service, and the monthly 
energy meter reading on the host account registers that the customer has delivered more energy to the 
Company’s delivery system than the customer has consumed by the end of the monthly billing period, the 
customer shall be charged the Customer Charge and any appropriate demand charges based on the customer’s 
applicable Rate Schedule.  In addition, the Company shall receive and take ownership of the delivered energy 
from the customer and the Company shall credit the customer for that delivered energy on the next monthly billing 
period.  At the end of twelve consecutive monthly billing periods beginning with the first month in which net 
metering becomes applicable (annualized period), the customer will be compensated for any remaining credits 
at the average locational marginal price for energy, for the annualized period, in the Pennsylvania, New Jersey 
and Maryland Interconnection (PJM) Control Area Transmission Zone for the Company.  In the event that a 
customer leaves Basic Generation Service prior to the end of the annualized period, the end of the service period 
will be treated as if it were the end of the annualized period; or 
 
c)  If the customer has a third party supplier and the monthly energy meter reading on the host account registers that 
the customer has delivered more energy to the Company’s delivery system than the customer has consumed by 
the end of the monthly billing period, the customer shall be charged the Customer Charge and any appropriate 
demand charges based on the customer’s applicable Rate Schedule. Monthly meter data will be forwarded to the 
customer’s third party supplier in accordance with existing Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Standards.  In the 
event that a customer changes electric supplier prior to the end of the annualized period, the end of the service 
period will be treated as if it were the end of the annualized period. 
 
The customer has one opportunity to select an annualized billing period in accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C. 
14:8-4.3. 
 
RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS 
The Renewable Energy Credits generated by the customer-generator facility are owned entirely by the customer or 
the eligible customer’s assignee.   
 
METERING 
The watt-hour energy meter at the customer’s location shall measure the net energy consumed by the customer or 
the net energy delivered by the customer-generator facility for the monthly billing period.  The Company shall 
furnish, install, maintain and own all the metering equipment needed for measurement of the service supplied. 
 
MODIFICATION OF THE COMPANY’S SYSTEM 
If it is necessary for the Company to extend or modify portions of its systems to accommodate the delivery of electricity 
from the customer-generator facility, the Company, at the customer’s sole expense, shall perform such extension or 
modification. 
 
LIABILITY 
The Company accepts no responsibility whatsoever for damage or injury to any person or property caused by failure 
of the customer to operate in compliance with Company’s requirements. The Company shall not be liable for any loss, 
cost, damage or expense to any party resulting from the use or presence of electric current or potential which 
originates from the customer-generator facility.  Connection by the Company under this Rider does not imply that the 
Company has inspected or certified that the customer-generator facility has complied with any necessary local codes 
or applicable safety or performance standards.  All inspections, certifications and compliance with applicable local 
codes and safety requirements are the sole responsibility of the customer-generator.

II.  DETERMINATION OF THE CONSERVATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM 
 
1.  At the end of the Annual Period, a calculation shall be made that determines for each Rate Schedule 
the deficiency or excess to be surcharged or credited to customers pursuant to the CIP mechanism. The 
deficiency or excess shall be calculated each month by multiplying the result obtained from subtracting the 
Baseline Revenue per Customer from the Actual Revenue per Customer by the Actual Number of Customers, 
and then multiplying the resulting usage by the Margin Revenue Factor. 
 
2.  The weather-related change in customer usage shall be calculated as the difference between actual 
CDD and HDD and the above CDD and HDD multiplied by the weather normalization factors and multiplying 
the result by the margin revenue factors of this Rate Schedule to determine the weather-related deficiency or 
excess. The weather-related amount will be subtracted from the total deficiency or excess to determine the 
non-weather-related deficiency or excess. 
 
3.  Recovery of margin deficiency associated with non-weather-related changes in customer usage 
will be subject to a Basic General Service (“BGS”) savings test and a Variable Margin Revenue recovery 
limitation (“recovery tests”).  Recovery of non-weather-related margin deficiency will be limited to the 
smaller of (1) the level of BGS savings achieved when such savings are less than 75 percent of the non-
weather-related margin deficiency, i.e. BGS savings test, and (2) 6.5 percent of variable margins for the 
CIP Annual Period, i.e., Variable Margin Revenue recovery limitation.  Any amount that exceeds the 
above limitations may be deferred for future recovery and is subject to either or both recovery tests in a 
future year consistent with the amount by which either or both non-weather-related margin deficiency 
exceeded the recovery tests.  For the purposes of this calculation, the value of the weather-related 
portion shall be calculated as set forth in Section II.2 of this Rate Schedule.

4.  In addition, if the calculated Return on Equity (“ROE”) exceeds the allowed ROE from the utility's last 
base rate case by 50 basis points or more, recovery of lost revenues through the CIP shall not be allowed for 
the applicable filing period. For purposes of this section, the Company's rate of return on common equity shall 
be calculated by dividing the Company's net income for the applicable period as defined in the Average 13-
Month Common Equity Balance by the Company's average common equity balance for the same period, all 
as reflected in the Company's monthly reports to the Board of Public Utilities. The Company's Average 13-
Month Common Equity Balance shall be the ratio of Electric Distribution Net Plant (including the Electric 
Distribution allocation of Common Plant) to the total Company Net Plant for the Average 13 Month Common 
Equity Balance period multiplied by the Company’s total common equity for the same period. 
 
5.  The amount to be surcharged or credited shall equal the eligible aggregate deficiency or excess 
for all months during the Annual Period determined in accordance with the provisions herein, divided by 
the Forecast Annual Usage for the Rate Schedule. 
 
III. TRACKING THE OPERATION OF THE CONSERVATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM 
 
The revenues billed, or credits applied, net of taxes and assessments, through the application of 
the Conservation Incentive Program Rate shall be accumulated for each month of the Adjustment 
Period and applied against the CIP excess or deficiency from the Annual Period and any 
cumulative balances remaining from prior periods.

Remote Net Energy Metering 
 
Limitations and Qualifications for Remote Net Metering (BPU Docket No. QO18070697, Orders dated 
September 17, 2018 and August 18, 2021)  
 
The Clean Energy Act, P.L. 2018, Chapter 17, Section 6 required the BPU to establish an application and approval 
process to facilitate Remote Net Metering in which a public entity certified to act as a host customer with a solar 
electric energy project may allocate credits to other public entities within the same electric public utility service territory. 
On September 17, 2018, the Board established the application and approval process and defined public entity for 
Remote Net Metering, in Docket No. QO18070697; this process was further clarified by Order dated August 18, 2021.  
 
To qualify for Remote Net Metering a customer must be a public entity, which is a State entity, school district, county, 
county agency, county authority, county community college, municipality, municipal agency, municipal authority or 
public  university  that  has  completed  the  BPU-approved  application  process  and  received  BPU  approval  for 
certification as a participant eligible to receive Remote Net Metering credits. A host customer is a public entity that 
proposes to host a solar electric generation facility on its property in the Atlantic City Electric Co. (“ACE” or the 
“Company”) service territory. The entities designated to receive credits are considered to be receiving customers.  
Receiving customers must be public entities also located in the ACE service territory. Both the host customer and the 
receiving customer must be a customer of record of ACE.  Receiving customers must maintain positive bill payment 
practices on their ACE account to remain eligible for credits. There may be no more than 10 receiving customer 
accounts per host customer.  Host customer and receiving customers must be served by Basic Generation Service 
(“BGS”) or be supplied by the same (third-party) energy supplier.  None of the accounts can be included in a previous 
aggregation for another qualified customer facility or be a NEM customer.   
 
Eligible public entities must follow the established application and approval process to certify public entities to act as 
a host customer for Remote Net Metering, requiring submittal of the BPU-approved form of “Public Entity Certification 
Agreement” used by the host customers and receiving customers, which shall be fully executed and provided to ACE 
and the BPU, reviewed by the Staff of the BPU, and approved by the BPU prior to the application of any Remote Net 
Metering credits. The Public Entity Certification Agreement is available on the New Jersey Clean Energy Program 
website as well as the Company’s website in the section dedicated to information regarding net metering and 
interconnection processes. The standard form “Public Entity Certification Agreement” must be fully executed by the 
host customer and each receiving customer, be accompanied by the BPU-approved standard form of Interconnection 
Application (Part 1) as used for all net metered projects and be delivered to both BPU Staff and the Company. The 
Company and BPU Staff will review the Public Entity Certification Agreement for administrative completeness. Within 
10 business days, the Company will provide its input to BPU Staff, whereupon BPU Staff will issue a notice of its 
findings to the contact person listed on the form. Following the issuance of a notice of administrative completeness, 
the Company will have 20 business days to review the application for eligibility and feasibility, including the proposed 
system size and all account information and make a recommendation to BPU Staff to approve or deny. In the case of 
a recommendation of denial, the Company will provide to BPU Staff a description of the deficiencies and potential 
means to correct the deficiencies. BPU Staff will present the fully executed “Public Entity Certification Agreement” 
and Part 1 of the Interconnection application to the Board with a recommendation for approval or denial.  The 
Company, contingent on the cooperation of the Public Entity Applicant(s), will continue to perform any additional 
technical processing of the eligible public entities’ interconnection application, subject to the Board’s final approval or 
denial. ACE is not responsible for resolving disputes which may arise between host customer and receiving 
customers.      
 
Host Customer Solar Electric Generator Sizing for Remote Net Metering: The size of a host customer’s solar 
electric generation facility shall be limited to the installed capacity that can produce electricity on an annual basis in 
an amount not to exceed the total average usage of the applicable host customer’s electric account(s) with the 
Company. The host customer is not required to use more than one account for purposes of sizing the solar electric 
generation facility. However, the solar facility must be located on property containing at least one Company electric 
meter for the host customer. The host customer must identify which account(s) to use to calculate the total average 
usage for the previous 12 months of consumption in kWhs. The total quantity of annual, historic consumed kWh will 
be divided by the number of accounts, if more than one account is used, and 1,200 annual kWh per kilowatt 
(“kWdc”) to arrive at the maximum capacity for the solar electric generation facility in kWs (“kWdc” and “kWac”).

Billing and Credits for Remote Net Metering: No more than 10 receiving accounts may be party to a Public Entity 
Certification Agreement and no less than 10% of the solar electric generating facility output may be allocated to a 
receiving customer account and intended primarily to offset all or part of the receiving customer’s own electricity 
requirements except to the extent that 10% of the solar electric generating facility output is greater. Receiving 
customers must maintain positive payment practices on their ACE accounts to remain eligible to receive credits. 
The terms and conditions of the Public Entity Certification Agreement, including all designated receiving accounts 
and their associated percentage of output allocations, shall be fixed throughout the annualized period with the 
exception of a once per annum opportunity to reallocate upon BPU’s approval of a revision to a Public Entity 
Certification Agreement, which is re-executed with all parties’ approval, including the Company. The host customer 
shall agree to the installation of a revenue grade production meter at its expense that is specified, owned, and 
installed by the Company.  This revenue grade production meter will record the solar generation at the host site. On 
a monthly basis, the Company shall use the metered kWh data produced by the solar electric generation facility on 
the host customer property to calculate the credits due to receiving customers. The monthly output will be allocated 
to receiving customers according to the percentage allotments indicated on the approved Public Entity Certification 
Agreement. The value of a Remote Net Metering credit will reflect a rough approximation of the generation, 
transmission and distribution value of a kWh produced by the solar electric generation facility. Each credited kWh 
for a receiving customer shall offset the variable kWh charges of a receiving customer, except for the SBC charge. 
No fixed, demand ($/kW), customer or SBC charges shall be offset by a remote net metering credit. On a monthly 
basis, the Company will credit an apportioned amount of kWh output from the solar facility in the form of kWh to be 
deducted from the kWh consumed by the receiving customers according to the percentage allotments indicated on 
the approved Public Entity Certification Agreement. The apportioned amount of solar electricity generated in kWh, 
the gross amount of electricity consumed and the net amount of kWh after credit allocation will be identified on the 
monthly electric bills of the designated receiving customer account. The receiving customers will be charged the 
SBC amounts attributable to the apportioned credit kWh. The application of an annualized period as currently used 
in the net metering rules at N.J.A.C. 14:8-4.2 shall apply to remote net metering host customers and receiving 
customers. Any excess generation for an individual receiving customer account after a monthly credit allocation 
shall be carried over to the next month within the annualized period. If an individual receiving customer account 
holds credits at the end of an annualized period, the account shall be trued up consistent with current net metering 
practice, with excess kWh compensated at the average annual LMP in the Company’s transmission zone.  
 
Remote Net Metering customers shall be responsible for all interconnection costs.

Community Solar Energy Pilot Program 
 
General  
 
The Community Solar Energy Pilot Program is open to customers of all rate classes who subscribe to community 
solar projects that are approved by the BPU. Community solar projects and customer subscribers to those approved 
projects must meet the following minimum requirements, and the full requirements defined in N.J.A.C. 14:8-9.1, et 
seq., in accordance with N.J.S.A. 48:3-87.11. The program provides for the participation of customers of the 
Company in all rate classes as subscribers to BPU approved community solar projects that are located within the 
service territory of the Company, but may be remotely located from the subscriber’s electric service address, and 
receive a credit on their utility bills in accordance with their participation share. Existing solar projects may not apply 
to requalify as a Community Solar Energy Pilot Program project. The Pilot Program shall run for a period of no more 
than 36 months, divided into Program Year 1 (PY1), Program Year 2 (PY2), and Program Year 3 (PY3). PY1 shall 
begin February 19, 2019, and last until December 31, 2019. Subsequent program years shall begin on January 1 
and last for the full calendar year. For each of the three program years, BPU staff shall initiate an annual application 
process. The annual capacity limit in the Company’s service territory each year shall be calculated by the BPU by 
multiplying the Company’s percentage of in-State retail electric sales by the total statewide capacity approved for 
that year. In PY1, this represented approximately 9.6 MW based upon the Company’s 12.8% share of the 75 MW 
available statewide capacity. Any unallocated capacity at the end of a program year may be reallocated to 
subsequent program years. At least 40 percent of the annual capacity limit shall be allocated to low and moderate 
income community (LMI) solar projects. The application and criteria for selection of community solar projects is 
managed by the BPU. Only projects that are selected by the BPU will be eligible to participate in the Pilot Program. 
The capacity limit for individual community solar pilot projects is set at a maximum of 5 MWs per project, measured 
as the sum of the nameplate capacity in DC rating of all PV panels comprising the community solar facility. The 
minimum number of participating subscribers for each community solar project shall be set at 10 subscribers and 
the maximum number of participating subscribers for each community solar project shall be set at 250 subscribers 
per one MW installed capacity (prorated to project capacity). Each community solar project must be equipped with 
at least one utility grade meter to facilitate the recording of solar generation underlying the bill credit process. 
 
Selected Definitions (N.J.A.C. 14:8-9.2)

Community solar pilot projects shall comply with all current and future applicable interconnection requirements, as 
set forth in N.J.A.C. 14:8-9.9(a) and N.J.A.C. 14:8-5 and shall be processed by the Company following normal 
interconnection procedures. 
 
Although projects are not required to have submitted an interconnection agreement or have an executed 
interconnection agreement prior to applying to the Pilot Program with the BPU, projects may file an interconnection 
application with the Company prior to being selected by the BPU at their own risk and cost. Additionally, only 
projects that have been approved by the BPU to participate in the Pilot Program are eligible to allocate community 
solar bill credits. 
 
 
Subscription Requirements  
 
Community solar pilot project subscriptions shall not exceed 100 percent of the subscriber's historic annual usage, 
calculated over the past 12 months, available at the time of the application. In cases where a 12-month history is 
not available, the community solar subscriber organization shall estimate, in a commercially reasonable manner, a 
subscriber's load based on available history. No single subscriber shall subscribe to more than 40 percent of a 
community solar project's total annual net energy. Subscriptions are portable, provided that the subscriber remains 
within the original Company service territory as the community solar pilot project to which they are subscribed. 
 
Appropriate notice of the change in residence and/or location must be provided to the Company, no later than 30 
days after the effective date of the change in residence and/or location. In cases of relocation, subscribers are 
entitled to one revision per move to their subscription size to account for a change in average consumption. 
 
Subscriptions may be sold or transferred back to the project owner or community solar subscriber organization by 
subscribers as specified in their subscription agreements. Subscribers may not sell or transfer a subscription to 
another party other than the project owner or community solar subscriber organization. A subscriber may not 
participate in more than one community solar project. It is the responsibility of the subscriber organization to verify 
that their subscribers are not already subscribed to another community solar project. The Company shall establish, 
in coordination with BPU staff, a standardized process by which community solar subscriber organizations can 
submit on a monthly basis the list of subscribers for a community solar project, and their respective participation 
shares. The Company shall apply the community solar bill credit to subscribers’ utility bills in proportion to each 
subscriber’s participation share, in conformance with the bill credit calculation method described below.

Community Solar Bill Credits  
 
Participating subscriber customers will receive a dollar-based bill credit for their subscribed percentage of the 
monthly kilowatt-hour output of the community solar project in proportion to the subscriber's share of the community 
solar project as indicated on the most recent list received from the subscriber organization. The monthly dollar credit 
on the subscriber’s bill will be the equivalent of their subscription percentage of the community solar project monthly 
kilowatt-hour generation amount applied to all kilowatt-hour charges on the subscriber’s bill, excluding all fixed and 
non-bypassable charges and SUT. The non-bypassable charges are the fixed monthly customer charge, all kW 
demand charges (if applicable), the SBC charge, the NGC charge, the TBC charge, the MTC-Tax charge and the 
ZEC charge. The value of the bill credit shall be set at the retail rate for their respective service classification. The 
BGS bill credit for CIEP eligible customers will be set at the average prior calendar year hourly Locational Marginal 
Price (LMP) of energy in the ACE PJM zone. Customers served by a third-party supplier will have their credit based 
upon the BGS rate. The subscriber’s bill credit will be used to offset the subscriber’s total bill up to the amount of 
actual metered consumption. The calculation of the value of the bill credit shall remain as described above and shall 
remain in effect for the life of the project, defined as no more than 20 years from the date of commercial operation of 
the project or the period until the project is decommissioned, whichever comes first, in addition to any modifications 
subsequently ordered by the BPU. The community solar bill credit will be specifically identified as the community 
solar bill credit in a separate section on the subscribers' utility bills. 
 
An annualized period shall be established for each subscriber. The annualized period shall begin on the day a 
subscriber first earns a community solar bill credit based on the delivery of energy, and continues for a period of 12 
months, until the subscription ends, or until the subscriber’s Company account is closed, whichever occurs earlier. 
The Company may sync up the monthly billing period of subscribers and projects, by modifying, with due notice 
given, the monthly billing period for subscribers upon their first month of participation in the community solar project. 
Excess credits above the level of the metered monthly consumption shall carry over from monthly billing period to 
monthly billing period, with the balance of credits accumulating until the earlier of either the end of the annualized 
period, the closure of the subscriber’s Company account, or the end of the subscriber’s community solar 
subscription. At the end of the annualized period and/or when a subscriber’s Company account is closed and/or at 
the end of the subscriber’s community solar subscription, any excess net bill credits greater than the sum of all 
appropriate billable charges shall be compensated at the Company’s average prior calendar year hourly Locational 
Marginal Price (LMP) of energy in the ACE PJM zone. The excess compensation must be returned to the 
subscriber by bill credit, wire transfer, or check. If a subscriber receives net excess credits for each of the three 
previous consecutive years, the subscriber organization must resize the subscriber’s subscription size to ensure it 
does not exceed 100 percent of historic annual usage, calculated over the past 12 months, available at the time of 
the reassessment. 
 
Any generation delivered to the grid that has not been allocated to a subscriber may be banked by the project 
operator in a dedicated project Company account for an annualized period of up to 12 months. The banked credits 
may be distributed by the project operator to any new or existing subscriber during that 12-month period, in 
conformance with subscription requirements set forth in N.J.A.C. 14:8-9.6. At the end of the up to 12-month period, 
any remaining generation credits shall be compensated at the Company’s average prior calendar year hourly 
Locational Marginal Price (LMP) of energy in the ACE PJM zone. Subscribers must have an active electric account 
within the Company’s service territory of the community solar project to which they are subscribed. Upon Company 
request, if required by the Company, subscribers must agree to a remote read smart meter upon EDC request, 
purchased and installed at EDC cost.
