DETERMINATION OF DEMAND:  The KW used for billing purposes shall be the maximum 15-minute 
integrated kilowatt demand during each billing month calculated to the nearest one-tenth KW.  In instances 
where the Company has determined that the demand will not exceed 10 KW, and has therefore elected 
to not install a demand meter, the demand shall be considered less than 10 KW for billing purposes.  
Where Service is rendered under Special Provision (a), the on-peak demand shall be the maximum 15-
minute integrated kilowatt demand created during the on-peak hours of 8 AM to 8 PM prevailing time, 
Monday through Friday each billing month, while the off-peak demand shall be the maximum demand 
created during the remaining hours.  A Contract Demand not less than the actual monthly demands may 
also be specified for mutually agreeable contract purposes.  
 
TERM OF CONTRACT:  None, except that reasonable notice of service discontinuance will be required.  
Where special circumstances apply or special or unusual facilities are supplied by the Company, a contract 
of one year or more to supply such facilities or accommodate special circumstances may be required for 
any Full Service Customer and any Delivery Service Customer. 
 
TERMS OF PAYMENT:  Bills are due when rendered by the Company and become overdue when 
payment is not received by the Company on or before the due date specified on the bill.  Overdue bills 
thereafter become subject to a late payment charge as described in Section 3.19, Part II. 
 
SERVICE CHARGE:  A Service Charge of $14.00 shall be applicable for initiating service to a customer 
under any Service Classification (see Part II, Section 2.01).  A $54.00 Service Charge shall be applicable

reconnection of service at the same location within a 12-month period shall not be relieved of Minimum 
Demand Charges resulting from demands created during the preceding eleven months, even though 
occurring prior to such disconnection. 
Customers who request more than one disconnection and reconnection of service at the same location 
within a 12-month period shall be subject to the conditions specified above for the first such period of 
disconnection.  In addition, for subsequent periods of disconnection, the customer shall be required to pay 
an additional Reconnection Charge equivalent to the sum of the Minimum Demand Charges, determined

LED Street Lighting Service 
 
TERM OF CONTRACT: Fifteen years for each fixture installation and thereafter on a monthly basis. Where 
special circumstances apply or special or unusual facilities are supplied, contracts of more than fifteen years 
may be required. Service which is terminated before the end of the contract term shall be billed the total of 
1) the fixture’s monthly Fixture Charge plus 2) the per KWH Distribution Charge applicable to the fixture’s 
Billing Month KWH, times the remaining months of the contract term.   
 
TERMS OF PAYMENT: Bills are due when rendered by the Company and become overdue when payment 
is not received by the Company on or before the due date specified on the bill. Overdue bills thereafter 
become subject to a late payment charge as described in Section 3.19, Part II. 
 
MISCELLANEOUS: 
Non-Standard Installations:   Where the installation of additional facilities, including, but not limited to: 
poles, wire, transformers, and brackets, is required to provide service to a fixture, Customers shall be 
responsible for payment of a non-refundable Contribution in Aid of Construction determined under Appendix 
A charges (see Tariff Part II) when applicable, or otherwise under billing work order costs estimates, which 
costs are subject to gross-up for applicable income taxes. 
 
(a) Changes in Fixture Wattage, Type or Location:  Customers will be required to pay the cost for 
relocation, changes in fixture wattage, fixture type, color (Kelvin temperature) and conversion from an LED 
light source to another when the age of the fixture is less than 15 years. These costs will include removal 
cost less salvage and installation cost of the fixture.  Except for relocations, the cost will also include the 
remaining net book value of the existing fixture and, in the case of Contribution Fixtures, payment of the 
Contributed Installation Cost. 
i)  Installation of a new fixture at the same location of the removal of an existing fixture within 12 
months will be considered a replacement of the existing fixture and will be subject to charges 
including the removal cost less salvage for the fixture removed, the installation cost of the new 
fixture and, if applicable, any Contribution Installation Cost.   
ii)  LED conversions of sodium vapor, mercury vapor or incandescent fixtures shall be scheduled 
at the Company's reasonable discretion.  JCP&L reserves the right to limit the number of 
fixtures conversions in any year to no more than 5% of the total fixtures served at the end of 
the previous year. 
 
(b) Traffic Control:   The Municipality will be responsible for providing and paying the costs of police 
assistance when deemed necessary by local authorities.  The Company will provide basic traffic control 
(flaggers) at no cost to the Municipality.  When traffic control (flagging) labor hours exceed construction 
labor hours (considered non-basic traffic control) the Municipality will be responsible for paying the 
differential in costs between basic and non-basic traffic control.  The Municipality will also be responsible 
for all fees associated with required permitting.   
 
(c) Seasonal Service:  Such Service will be rendered when the cost of disconnection and reconnection is 
paid by the customer.  During such months of disconnection, the Billing Month KWH for the fixture will be 
zero.  Only the monthly Fixture Charge and a seasonal Distribution Charge will be billed (i.e., Basic 
Generation  Service  and  other  Delivery  Service  charges  will  not  be  billed)  during  such  months  of 
disconnection.  The seasonal Distribution Charge will be equal to the Billing Month KWH for the light on a 
standard illumination schedule, times the per KWH Distribution Charge. 
 
(d) General: The Company reserves the right to modify from time to time its specifications relating to street 
lighting equipment and its installation in order to meet changing conditions. Installations subject to 
vandalism may be removed at the option of the Company, unless such maintenance costs are provided by 
the customer.

St. Lawrence Hydroelectric Power  
 
At the November 9, 2004 agenda meeting, the BPU verbally approved, among other things, the Public 
Power Association of New Jersey (“PPANJ”) as Bargaining Agent for the State of New Jersey to 
renegotiate with the New York Power Authority (“NYPA”), on the allocation of service tariff capacity and 
associated energy produced at the St. Lawrence/FDR project (In the Matter of the Allocation of St. 
Lawrence Hydroelectric Power to the State of New Jersey Docket No. EO04101124). 
 
On December 21, 2004, the PPANJ filed with the BPU the following documents associated with the St. 
Lawrence Hydroelectric Power matter: 1) Agreement for Electric Service Investor Owned Utility Between 
the PPANJ and JCP&L, PSE&G, Rockland Electric and Atlantic City Electric Company; 2) Agreement 
Governing Administration of NYPA Power (“Administration Agreement”); and 3) PPANJ for State of New 
Jersey Service Tariff Capacity and Associated Energy. 
 
Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Company, as Nominal Recipient of the Investor-Owned 
Electric Utilities’ share of St. Lawrence/FDR project, is responsible to deliver and distribute the capacity 
and associated energy as Basic Generation Service to residential customers as designated by the BPU. 
In addition, the Company is responsible to distribute to each of the Investor-Owned Electric Utilities the 
Net  Economic  Benefits calculated according to  the Rate  Schedule attached  to the Administration 
Agreement. Each of the Investor-Owned Electric Utilities shall allocate the Net Economic Benefits 
distributed to it to its residential customers through the Investor-Owned Electric Utility’s applicable clause 
through which it recovers non-utility generation costs, or other appropriate rate mechanism if no such 
clause exists, in a manner that ensures that such benefits flow exclusively to residential customers. 
 
The Company, in its role as Nominal Recipient of the St. Lawrence/FDR project, advises the Investor-
Owned Electric Utilities of their respective allocation of the Net Economic Benefits for the period started 
January 1, 2019 through January 31, 2020. JCP&L’s share of the Net Economic Benefits totaled 
$137,272.61. 
 
Effective June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2021, a St. Lawrence Hydroelectric Power credit of $0.000015 
per KWH ($0.000016 per KWH including SUT) will be combined with the Secondary Voltages Adjusted 
NGC Charge applicable to Service Classifications RS, RT and RGT. Such combined NGC Charge shall 
be applied to all KWH usage of any Full Service or Delivery Service residential customers. 
 
Effective February 1, 2020, St. Lawrence Allocation shall be exclusively assigned to the municipally owned 
utilities and rural electric cooperative in New Jersey.  The Company ceases to receive any Net Economic 
Benefits of St. Lawrence Project’s allocation.

Rider RAC 
Remediation Adjustment Clause 
 
 
APPLICABILITY: Rider RAC determines a Remediation Adjustment in accordance with the formula set 
forth below.  The factor is included in the Societal Benefits Charge applicable to all KWH usage of any 
Full Service Customer or Delivery Service Customer. 
 
The calculated RAC rate shall be prepared by the Company and filed with the BPU annually by the end of 
December with a requested effective date of June 1 of the subsequent year.  Rider RAC provides for the 
recovery of manufactured gas plant remediation costs (net of insurance and other recoveries) over rolling 
seven year periods, including carrying costs on the unamortized balance.  Carrying cost is calculated on 
a monthly basis at an interest rate equal to the rate on seven-year constant maturity Treasuries, as shown 
in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release on or closest to January 1 of each year, plus sixty basis points, 
compounded annually as of January 1 of each year. 
 
CALCULATION OF THE REMEDIATION ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE FACTOR: 
 
1)  By using the following formula: 
 
  RAC = Recoverable Cost / Sales 
 
2)  Where the terms are defined as follows: 
 
RAC = The Remediation Adjustment Clause factor in cents per KWH to be applied to all applicable 
retail KWH sales. 
 
Recoverable Cost = Manufactured Gas Plant remediation expenses (net of insurance and other 
recoveries) amortized over rolling seven year periods.  The cost includes carrying costs on any 
unamortized balance of remediation costs, net of associated deferred tax balance, at an annual 
interest rate stated above. 
 
  Sales = The Company's forecasted retail KWH sales. 
 
3)  Effective September 1, 2022, the RAC computation is as follows ($ Millions): 
 
  RAC = $15.454 / 19,185,264 MWH = $0.000806 per KWH 
      ($0.000859 per KWH including SUT)

Uncollectible costs include carrying costs on any unamortized balances of such costs at the applicable 
interest rate approved by the BPU in its Final Order dated May 17, 2004 (Docket Nos. ER02080506, et 
al.). Such interest rate shall be the rate actually incurred on the Company’s short-term debt (debt maturing 
in one year or less), or the rate on equivalent temporary cash investments if the Company has no short-
term debt outstanding. Interest shall be computed monthly based on the beginning and ending average 
monthly balance net of deferred income taxes, compounded annually (added to the balance on which 
interest is accrued annually) on January 1 of each year.

Rider QFS   
Cogeneration and Small Power Production Service 
 
AVAILABILITY:  Rider QFS specifies the conditions under which the Company will purchase electricity 
from a ""Qualifying Facility"" (""QF"") under Section 210 of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. 
Rider QFS is available to customers taking service under Service Classifications GS, GST, GP and GT. 
QF installations must conform to, and are responsible for all costs associated with, the Company's General 
Interconnect  Requirements  for  Customer's  Generation,  according  to  any  applicable  installation 
specifications. (See Part II, Section 10) 
 
QF INSTALLATIONS WITH MORE THAN 1000 KW GENERATING CAPACITY   
Such installations shall negotiate with the Company for specific contract arrangements to determine the 
price, term and conditions to delivered energy and capacity, where applicable; provided however, that in 
no event shall payments to the QF installation under this tariff exceed the revenues the Company receives 
from PJM (or its successor), net of PJM penalties and charges. Such contracts are subject to BPU 
approval. 
 
QF INSTALLATIONS WITH 1000 KW OR LESS GENERATING CAPACITY  
 
Service Charge: $40.00 monthly  
 
Energy Payment: Based on actual real-time PJM load weighted average Residual Metered Load 
Aggregate Locational Marginal Price (LMP) for the JCP&L Transmission Zone at the time when the QF 
installation delivers energy to the Company. 
 
Capacity Payment: Deliveries from a QF installation that qualify as a PJM Capacity Resource may 
receive capacity payments when the installed capacity of the QF installation exceeds 100 kW and meets 
the reliability criteria set forth in PJM Manual 18 (See www.pjm.com), as it may change from time to time. 
The Capacity Payment, if and as applicable, will be equal to the capacity revenues that the Company 
receives from PJM for selling such capacity into the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) capacity auction prior 
to delivery, adjusted for all other PJM penalties and charges assessed to the Company by PJM arising 
from, among other things, non-performance or unavailability of the QF installation. QF installations 
requesting capacity payments must execute an agreement with the Company authorizing the Company 
to offer such capacity into the PJM market, including terms and conditions of such sale, and including any 
required security. Any losses experienced by the Company resulting from a QF installation’s failure to 
perform shall be recovered under its Non-utility Generation Charge. 
 
Energy Payment and Capacity Payment, if any, net of Service Charge, shall be determined monthly on 
an after-the-fact basis, and made within 90 days of the QF meter reading date.   
 
METERING COSTS: QF customers shall pay all metering equipment and related costs as required by the 
Company and/or by PJM. 
 
 
INTERCONNECTION COSTS:  QF customers shall pay interconnection costs (see Part II, Section 4.05) 
and any line extension costs required to interconnect the QF to the Company’s facilities.

Transition Renewable Energy Certificate Incentive Program (TREC Program) 
 
On December 19, 2019, the Board issued an Order in Docket No. QO19010068 (“December 19, 2019 
Order”), establishing a transition renewable energy certificate (“TREC”) program to be implemented upon 
the attainment of 5.1% of the retail electric sales in the State being from solar.  Solar projects that become 
operational after the State’s attainment of the 5.1% milestone but prior to the implementation of a 
successor solar program will be eligible to participate in the TREC Program, as determined by the Board.  
The December 19, 2019 Order required the New Jersey Electric Distribution Companies (“EDCs”) to 
purchase all TRECs generated and authorized the EDCs to recover their reasonable and prudent costs 
incurred for the purchase of TRECs and the fees charged by a TREC Administrator (generally, “TREC 
Program Costs”). The December 19, 2019 Order further provided that “[r]ecovery shall be based on each 
EDC’s proportionate share of retail electric sales.” 
 
The TREC Rate recovers JCP&L’s proportional share of TREC Program Costs, including, but not limited 
to, those costs associated with the purchase of TRECs, fees charged by the TREC Administrator, and any 
additional costs or expenses incurred by JCP&L as a result of the Company’s participation in or 
implementation of the TREC program.   
 
The  TREC  Rate  for  all  customer  classes  is  $0.000523/kWh  ($0.000558  including  SUT),  effective 
September 1, 2020.

APPLICABILITY: Available to new and existing Residential and Multi-Family Customers being served on 
Service Classification RS, RST, RGT, GS who install a Company-qualified smart Electric Vehicle (“EV”) Level 
2 (“L2”) charger (“Eligible Customer”). This provision within Rider EV is voluntary and offers qualified 
customers the opportunity to receive a bill credit by charging an EV battery with a Company-qualified smart 
EV L2 charger during Off-Peak hours.  Customers must agree to share and communicate the charging data 
from their smart EV L2 charger via remote access with the Company to receive the bill credit.  Customers are 
not required to receive their generation supply through Basic Generation Service to be eligible for this Rider.  
This Rider is limited to 2,000 eligible residential and 75 eligible multi-family Customers on a first-come, first-
serve basis.  Only customers whose application is accepted by the Company will receive the Off-Peak Credit. 
 
RATE: Eligible Customers that qualify for this provision within this Rider will receive a credit of 2 cents per 
Kilowatt-hour (“kWh”) for Net Off-Peak kWh Usage at their smart EV L2 charger.  Net Off-Peak kWh Usage 
is calculated as kWh usage recorded by the Customer’s smart EV Level 2 charger during Off-Peak hours less 
kWh usage recorded by the Customer’s smart EV L2 charger during On-Peak hours.  Net Off-Peak kWh 
Usage must be a positive value for the Customer to receive a credit.  In the event Off-Peak kWh less On-
Peak kWh is less than zero, the Net Off-Peak kWh Usage shall be considered zero for the measurement 
period. JCP&L will provide the on-bill credits1 to residential customers on a quarterly basis, which bill credits 
will terminate when the budget has been exhausted or the Program has terminated.  Quarterly off-peak bill 
credits for eligible non-residential customers will be paid via off-bill credit. 
On-Peak hours are Monday through Friday from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time.  All other 
hours including weekend hours will be considered off-peak.  The Company reserves the right to change the 
on-peak hours from time to time as the on-peak periods of the supply system change. The Company may 
also selectively stagger the on-peak hours up to one hour in either direction when required to alleviate local 
distribution system peaking within high-density areas. The off-peak hours will not, however, be less than 7 
hours daily. 
TERM: Month to month basis. This provision within this Rider will be available until the earlier of the Company 
modifying the Off-Peak Credit program or July 15, 2026.

2)  Customer Make-Ready Incentive: 
APPLICABILITY: Provides incentives for the Make-Ready Work on the customer-side of the meter necessary 
to enable the installation of a Company-qualified EV Charger.  The available make-ready incentives do not 
include the cost of the charger.  Available to all Eligible Customers located in the territory served by the 
Company.  Eligible Customers must install a Company-qualified EV L2 charger or Direct Current Fast Charger 
(“DCFC”), subject to the limitations outlined below and the Program Terms established by the Company and 
available at www.jcp-l.com/evdriven.   
The Company will provide an incentive to Customers served under Schedule RS, RT, RGT, GS, GST, GP, 
and GT who install a Company-qualified smart EV Level 2 charger or DCFC after the commencement date 
of the Program. The smart EV L2 charger or DCFC must be connected after the Company meter and must 
be owned by the Customer receiving the incentive. The smart EV L2 charger for other than residential and 
multi-family applications and DCFC applications must be publicly-accessible charging ports.  In accordance 
with Board’s Order approving the Program in BPU Docket No. EO21030630, “publicly-accessible charging” 
means a charger located on public land, a community location, or travel corridor.  Such chargers are owned 
and operated by site owner, property manager or management company, EVSE Infrastructure Company, or, 
in limited cases, an EDC, that is accessible to the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week; however, generic 
parking restrictions or requirements, such as in a commercial garage, or emergency restrictions, including 
construction, street cleaning, etc., are not applicable.  Such chargers may charge the EV owner a fee for 
charging; such fees will be clearly displayed to the user.  Customers are not required to receive their 
generation supply through Basic Generation Service to be eligible for the incentive. A list of qualifying smart 
EV L2 chargers is available on the Company’s website at www.jcp-l.com/evdriven. 
In order to qualify for the Company incentive, the Customer must submit an application with all necessary 
supporting documentation within 30 days of installation (including copies of receipts and/or invoices of the 
smart EV L2 charger or DCFC purchase and installation costs) and agree to share and communicate the 
charging data from the smart EV L2 charger or DCFC with the Company. The Customer is responsible for 
maintenance and enabling the smart capabilities of the EV L2 charger or DCFC. Once the Company receives 
the Customer’s completed application and confirms that the Customer’s smart EV L2 charger or DCFC has 
been installed and is available for service and capable of remote communication, and approves the 
application, the Company shall issue the applicable incentive. The program only applies to eligible smart EV 
L2 chargers and DCFCs installed on or after July 15, 2022. Customer Make-Ready Incentives will be paid in 
an amount, not to exceed the amount stated in the table below for new service to EV chargers for each 
subprogram, based on the actual documented cost of the make-ready work, excluding the cost of the charger:
